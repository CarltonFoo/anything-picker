		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Scale@Peiying: SCALE@Peiying is a 6-year Learning for Life Programme (LLP) that focuses on sports, character development and adventure learning. The LLP provides students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their interaction skills. Peiying has its own Adventure Tower that enables the school to carry out outdoor adventure activities regularly on the school premises.   Code for fun: All P3 & P4 students go through a robotics programme that spans two years. Students start learning the fundamentals of computational thinking at Primary 3 and the programme is continued at Primary 4. This programme offers a fun and interactive way for students to learn programming skills.  It also enhances logical thinking, analytical skills and help students learn to organise data.    Project Work: Project Work provides P3 to P6 students with the opportunity to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning, and apply it to real life situations. Participation in Project Work enhances students' knowledge and enables them to acquire 21st Century competencies such as collaboration, communication and independent learning. It prepares them for lifelong learning and to face future challenges.    ACE Programme: Arts and Cultural Experiences (ACE) provides different platforms for our students to be immersed in the culture and arts of the different community groups. Students learn to appreciate our diverse cultural heritage through activities that range from learning to play in a kompang group to picking up Chinese Opera skills.   Hydroponics & Aeroponics Programme: Peiying adopts an experiential approach to the learning of Science. As part of the process of learning about plants, students grow vegetables using hydroponics and aeroponics. The vegetables that are harvested are distributed to needy families in the neighbourhood and adds a 'values-in-action' dimension to the programme."
