		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Learning for Life Programme (LLP) -\"i2can dance\"  The 'i2 Can Dance!' programme aims to foster confidence, resilience, adaptability and graciousness in our students. Our students' horizon are also widened through increased awareness of the different cultures in Singapore and beyond. Such awareness will also promote better understanding and respect for the different ethnic groups in Singapore  Through their participation in the programme, our students also learnt the school values of respect and responsibility, where they are taught to respect the dance form and fellow dancers, to be responsible for their own learning of dance as well as to know what is involved in dance, for instance choreography, technique, costumes and props.  The school takes a three-pronged approach to the i2Can Dance! programme:  Experience - It provides a broad-based learning for all.   Empowerment - It creates opportunities for our pupils to identify their interests and talents and also reflect on their learning and develop to become independent learners through self-assessment.  Enhancement and Excellence - It provides an enhanced experience for students who display dance potential. Talented dancers are given a platform to enhance their skills and develop holistically through overseas exchange programmes.  Values in Action (VIA) The Values in Action (VIA) in BPPS are rich learning experiences to inculcate active citizenship and civic responsibility among our students. VIA in BPPS begins with students learning how to care for oneself and progressively spiral up to caring for the local community. While the students celebrate their achievements of carrying out the VIA tasks, they also reflect on the values they have put into practice.  At the end of six years in BPPS, we believe that with the experiences that our students have gone through, they would be socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community."
