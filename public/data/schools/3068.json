This is anchored in our strong belief that both academic excellence and character development are pillars of a holistic education. As we develop our students' character, we nurture values and dispositions necessary for excellence in academic pursuits. Whilst we equip our students with knowledge and skills in the academic subjects, we also develop in them the competencies and attitudes to navigate the future. The Jurong West Experience, grounded in Student-Centricity, is premised in our belief that when students have an interest and find enjoyment in what they do, they will do well and find greater motivation to pursue those interests beyond secondary school. The school's value add academic results and strong CCA achievements, particularly in the Uniformed Groups, are testimony to the school's commitment to enable each student to reach his/her full potential. The school has a strong emphasis on Higher Education and Career Guidance. With accurate information on post-secondary pathways students are well placed to make informed choices. Professional development of our staff is a cornerstone in our goal to deliver relevant and engaging lessons and programmes.
