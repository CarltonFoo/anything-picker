		"School Mission": "To nurture every child to lead their lives responsibly and to contribute with joy.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "In Horizon Primary, we believe that every child is a confident individual who is able to grow and become a responsible citizen. Horizon's driving force is garnered from 3 significant areas; our learning environment, our philosophy of our students and the people who realise the School Vision.  Our learning environment is one that focuses on providing a wide range of learning platforms for holistic development. Thus the learning experiences are designed to grow a child holistically addressing the 5 domains - Moral, Cognitive, Physical, Social and Aesthetics. We aspire to develop in every child good character and nourish his or her intellectual, social and emotional well-being. This is accomplished through daily learning experiences and joyful activities offered through the I-LEAD curriculum, Safe Play@ Horizon, Leaders' Trail in Biodiversity, P5 Computational Thinking in Mathematics, sessions, Making Thinking Visible routines based Aesthetic lessons, Design Thinking for P4 Project Work, language acquisition efforts and a range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA).   As our philosophy is that 'Every Child a Leader', we focus strongly on character building and leadership development. I-LEAD is our leadership development programme for all students based on Steven R. Covey's 7 Habits and the school's values- Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence. The curriculum allows students to learn, practise and inculcate the 7 Habits and the school values through their daily learning experiences to become self-leaders.  The strong pillars of Horizon's vibrant learning environment are our staff and parents.  As a dedicated staff community, we strive to ensure that every student is taught to take charge of his or her personal growth to be a leader of self, who is both responsible and respected by others. Parents who are our firm and supportive partners work collaboratively to motivate, encourage and spur our students to be confident learners and leaders.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "I-LEAD is our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) that focuses on student leadership for the entire cohort. I-LEAD at Horizon is the central focus of our initiatives and programmes. It is our intention for all students to experience I-LEAD during their daily experiences and lessons through the common language that the teachers and peers use and via practising the skills of being a self-leader.  The I-LEAD framework maps out the levels of progression, central themes and objectives, skills, competencies and values to be developed.  The instructional design of I-LEAD curriculum has been customised and developed to allow all students to learn life skills and to build their character based on self-leadership through the 7 Habits and the school values. I-LEAD lessons are conducted on a weekly basis and the 7 Habits and the School Values are prominently featured in the co-curricular programmes comprising Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), Programmes for Active Learning (PAL), Values-in-Action (VIA), National Education (NE) and Socio-Emotional Learning (SEL) platforms.  There are two tiers to the Horizon's I-LEAD model for student leadership; the first tier has a primary purpose to develop every student as a self-leader at the progressive levels:-Self Leader (P1 and P2), Responsible Leader(P3 and P4) and Respected Leader (P5 and P6). All students get to experience class leadership roles on a rotational basis.  The second tier serves to identify and equip students who possess leadership qualities to be developed as student leaders from P3 level. Student leaders are School Captains, Programme Captains and CCA Leaders who will role model and lead their peers in the actualisation of the leadership skills."
