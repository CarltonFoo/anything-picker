		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "ALP-Art of Communication for Personal Excellence The ALP of the school seeks to enhance the depth of learning for students from Primary 2 to 5 in the areas of communication by providing them with opportunities to undergo training in Choral Reading, Reader's Theatre, Storytelling, and Public Speaking. To ensure the pervasiveness and sustainability of its ALP, the school has infused it into its school-based curriculum. Formalized platforms, through inter-department collaboration, are also put in place for students to share their experiences and opinions related to current affairs, racial harmony, science learning, outdoor education and healthy living with different audiences for different purposes. Students who possess aptitude and interest are identified for Tier 2 development whereby specialized training in the area of reporting and presenting are its key focus. In Tier 3 development, the school seeks to raise 30 Ambassadors who will be the spokesperson of the school in any school-run events. LLP-Experiential Learning of Lifeskills for Personal Excellence JWPS has adopted the stance of outdoor education as experiential learning, in, for, or about the outdoors. It refers to the range of school organized activities which heightens the students' Awareness of the outdoor via mastery lessons, deliberate Action via application of skills and concepts taught, and the engendering of desired Attitude via purposeful reflection and value-reinforcement. Students will learn to build self-confidence, leadership skills, create optimism and deal with risks. Programme for Active Learning (PAL) JWPS has implemented 4 modules namely, Visual Arts, Performing Arts, Sports & Games and Outdoor Education for its PAL. The modules, which are mainly conducted by its own staff, serve to complement existing PE, Art and Music in the school curriculum. The school has also held its PAL cum STELLAR Open House for all the parents of its Primary 1 to 3 cohorts of students for the fifth year running."
