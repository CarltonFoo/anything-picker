		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "White Sands Primary School believes in developing to the fullest the character and cognitive domains of our pupils. We endeavor to nurture future ready citizens who are grounded in the values of Care, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Rallying Together and Excellence. For children to have their unique talents and abilities developed to their fullest potential, a rich learning experience is provided to develop caring hearts, creative minds and confident individuals.   Contributing towards the school's holistic development of our pupils is the strong partnership with our parents and the community as we believe that it takes a village to raise a child. The school enjoys a good reputation in the community for the quality of all-round education it provides, distinctive for the good discipline and vibrant tone. This is affirmed through the need for the school to conduct balloting in the annual P1 registration exercise.   Key success factors which contribute to the positive learning outcomes of the pupils include customization of teaching and learning approaches that cater to pupils of different abilities. This customized approach allows for every pupil to learn at a suitable pace, starting from the foundation years. The strong learning support that has been put in place ensures that no child is left behind in the pursuit of excellence.   The school believes in building strong Teacher-Student relationship. This is made possible through the strong Character and Citizenship Education, which includes signature programmes such as heart-to-heart sessions between staff and pupils. All teachers, key personnel, school leaders are involved not only in the heart-to-heart sessions but in 'adopting' pupils so that they can feel belong and cared for in the school.",
