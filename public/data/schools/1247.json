		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "At Bukit Timah Primary School (BTPS), we believe that every child has intrinsic worth. He/She can learn and achieve when given the right environment and support. Like a sapling, a child needs scaffolding to stay rooted while given the space to grow.  The right environment is a safe and conducive environment whereby order and discipline is put in place so that the child is able to learn well.  He/she is able to develop at his/her own pace and is given opportunities to explore, discover and ask questions.   To build a strong foundation in literacy, numeracy and thinking skills, teachers will provide the support and guidance.  By encouraging and caring for the pupils, they will be able to explore and excel. By the end of the 6 years of education at BTPS, our pupils will be motivated, independent and self-directed learners.  They would be developed in all the five domains: moral, aesthetics, physical, intellectual and social emotional.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "At BTPS, we firmly believe that in order to fuel our students' minds, they must be actively involved in their own construction of knowledge.  The school has developed our Applied Learning Programme - Inquiry Based Learning supported by Thinking Routines to engage, enthuse and empower our students to be self-directed learners with a passion for learning. The school-wide pedagogical approach facilities the acquisition of the 21st century skills and competencies through thinking, collaborating and creating.  The 5E learning cycle of IBL - Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate - is used to craft rich learning experiences that meet the needs of our students. In order to respond positively to inquiry-based instruction, students learn Thinking Routines to articulate their thoughts and develop effective communication.   Other than IBL-TR, the school also believes that music, being a universal language, will fuel the hearts of our students and prepare them to be world-ready citizens. BTPS has a diverse music programme that engages and empowers the students. We equip all students with basic theoretical knowledge and provide them with opportunities to perform individually and as an ensemble with our \"Music for Everyone\"."
