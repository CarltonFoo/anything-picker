		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Jurongville Secondary provides a range of programmes to inculcate values and prepare our students for life. The school's two distinctive programmes are \"Sports for Life\" and \"Real World Learning Through Electronics\" programmes. \"Sports for Life\" is the school's Learning for Life programme. It exposes students to a variety of sports electives, empowers them to be leaders and enables those with talent to excel in a particular sport. The programme builds on the school's active sporting culture to allow all students to learn a wide range of sports and games, so that they develop positive attitudes towards a healthy lifestyle and are ready for active sports participation even beyond schooling years. Through the programme, students also learn to organise sports events and acquire useful skills, both in sports and in more generic domains. The school has also formed networks with many sporting associations and clubs to provide opportunities for students who demonstrate talent in these areas to train with these clubs. Values and life skills are taught explicitly through the school's \"Sports for Life\". This unique character development approach in complemented by a strong service learning and empowerment orientation of the school, where programmes like Values-in-Action (local & overseas), Level Camps, and the JVS Leadership Development Programme serve as authentic platforms for character building in all its students. Through our Applied Learning Programme, 'Real World Learning Through Electronics', we provide opportunities for our students to engage in authentic tasks and to acquire 21st Century Competencies. Students will learn and understand concepts and issues related to electronics, and work in teams to apply concepts learnt to solve electronic-related tasks. The infusion of Electronics Education into the curriculum is designed to achieve synergistic learning outcomes for students."
