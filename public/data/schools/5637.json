		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Applied Learning Programme: Competent, Confident and Respectful Communicators  CHIJ (Katong) Primary's ALP in Languages, Competent, Confident & Respectful Communicators, is aligned with the school's vision of nurturing girls to become women of grace and substance. It builds on the school's historical strength as CHIJ Katong Convent has been known for producing eloquent speakers.  Our ALP capitalises on our students' interests and strengths.  Many of our students have a high level of oral proficiency, particularly in English. The school has had a well-received Speech and Drama programme in the past and our students show keen interest in performing at various school activities such as Arts Week.   The ALP represents the shared vision of both the EL and MTL departments. (The EL department's vision is 'Empowered individuals who are proficient and confident users of the English Language'; the MT department's vision is 'Competence in Language, Unity in Culture'.)The ALP focuses specifically on nurturing oral communicators who are: Competent: Able to use language effectively for self-expression (e.g. drama; story-telling) and for  persuasion / advocacy (e.g. presentation; debate); Confident: Able to stand up in front of an audience to speak rationally, with substance and clarity;  Respectful: Able to be tactful, understanding the nuances of the language; able to listen with respectfulness, having empathy and cross-cultural understanding. The ALP is implemented as a whole-school approach through a 6-year progressive programme anchored by EL and MT teachers and reinforced by all teachers. The use of school-wide pedagogies such as Co-Operative Learning strategies (with an emphasis on Social Skills); Accountable Talk as an AfL strategy and Opening Up Talk in Subject Classroom, a WSA EC initiative, enables teachers to reinforce the outcomes of the ALP."
