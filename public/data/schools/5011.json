This will prepare them to assume life responsibilities in this fast-changing and globalised world.   Over the years, our students have performed well in both the academic and non-academic domains. Their success is largely due to our staff who see themselves as Canossian Educators working in close partnership with the families. Our school community is committed to developing our students into graceful and gracious young ladies who are anchored in the School Core Values of Charity, Humility and Forgiveness.",

Through our systematic Performing Arts curriculum, we foster in our students creativity, an appreciation of the arts and their heritage. The integrated curriculum also develops patriotism and a sense of belonging with an understanding of Singapore's past and appreciation of the present.   The school's other Learning for Life Programme, \"SACPS is FIT for Life - Building Resilience and Perseverance through Sports and Games\", seeks to develop in students the Canossian Attributes of Commitment, Compassion and Cheerfulness by focusing on a spirit of excellence, a culture of caring for team mates and true sportswoman-ship attitudes. All students progressively learn sport skills and participate in outdoor education that helps them develop resilience as part of the self-management and self-efficacy skills we seek to imbue in every student."
