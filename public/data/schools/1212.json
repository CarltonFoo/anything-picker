		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Through the school's vision, OEPS aims to create a positive learning environment and to provide meaningful learning experiences that nurture the child to be a caring and confident lifelong learner who strives for his/her best. The school believes that every child deserves the opportunity to learn and to grow as good role models, and to serve and to contribute back to the school and the society.  Building on the strong Culture of Care and focus on Character Development, the school strives to strengthen its total curriculum through multiple structured learning platforms that allow students to practise 21st Century Competencies so that they can be self-directed and stay resilient in their pursuit for both academic and non-academic excellence. For example, the strengthening of the school's student leadership programme is intended to provide leadership experience for all students in VIA service-learning projects so that they can internalize the importance of serving and contributing to the society.   The school strongly believes that nurturing the staff competencies and building effective partnerships with stakeholders are key drivers behind the delivery of total curriculum.   The school believes that a Good OEPS Teacher exhibits competencies in three key areas namely, as Collaborative Learners, Designers of Lessons and Reflective Practitioners. These are essential qualities to build positive teacher-student relationship and meeting the present and future needs of the students. The school also acknowledges that the Opera Parents Club (OPC) is a vital link to promote home-school partnerships. By leveraging on OPC's support and expertise, the school is able to offer students richer learning experiences such as International Friendship Day and Career Day.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school has structured key programmes to strengthen its delivery of holistic education and building 21st Century Competencies: a) The 'Ignite De Arts' programme aims to promote a deeper appreciation of the Arts in all students. The comprehensive 6-year programme infuses values education in four key domains: Learn Arts, Explore Arts, Collaborative Arts and Fun Arts. Through these meaningfully planned experiences, the students are able to see, think, hear and wonder, and in turn self-discover their potential and talents in Arts. b) Student Leadership (Learn to Lead, Lead to Serve): The school has set up a school-wide multi-tier structure to provide leadership development opportunities for all students. Leadership trainings are customized at class level and for upper primary students. They apply the leadership skills in their role as P5 buddy to new P1 students. Students who show greater aptitude are identified and further developed via additional leadership training and workshops to sharpen their leadership competencies.  With such skills set, they will be able to initiate action amongst peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others. With a greater ownership of the learning experiences, they will find the learning even more meaningful and likely be motivated to want to make a difference to the community. c) Character Education: The school sustains its positive school culture by adopting two school-wide approaches: Firstly, 'Learn Through Play' is a school-based programme anchored on the school's belief that students learn best during play and students are guided by trained staff to manage their emotions and actions when interacting with others. Secondly, the school adopts Restorative Practices to guide students to reflect on their actions and consequences so that they take responsibility for their actions and learn to care for others. Through these key approaches, the school has enhanced the social well-being of the students."
