		"School Mission": "Nurturing Every Child Holistically",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "The school believes in educating each child for life. It aspires to develop resilient children with joyful attributes of a growth mindset, a heart of appreciation and a sense of purpose; as well as to ground them in sound values that will withstand the test of time. We hope to develop confident life-long learners with the love for learning and have habits of a self-directed learner. We aim to provide opportunities for each child to become a caring leader, serving others and the community as well as play their part for the environment.   Towards this end, the school believes that it will 'take a village to raise a child'. In partnership with numerous partners, the school provides a unique Blangah Rise education experience customised to the needs of each child to maximise his or her potential. Ranging from outdoor experiences through the Southern Ridges located conveniently opposite the school, to having experiences of being an entrepreneur in Sentosa's Kidzflea, each child develops literacy, numeracy and 21st century skills to be future-ready.   The quality of the unique Blangah Rise experience will only be as good as the team of teachers who plans and delivers them. We believe in continually developing ourselves professionally to be skilful teachers who are caring and competent in what we do. And as a team we support and help each other in bringing out the best in us as well as our children. We thank our stakeholders for recognising our efforts through the numerous awards for inspiring teaching and innovation!",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The Blangah Rise Experience  The school offers a unique Blangah Rise education experience that is customized to the needs of each child. Based on the Skillful Teaching pedagogical approach, each lesson design is based on principles of learning and incorporates ways of managing attention, discipline and motivation of the learner.   The lesson design also considers the learning experiences and we differentiate our instructions based on the individual readiness and interests of each child. Hence a child who might require greater support will be given more scaffolding to build up his or her competencies. The learning experience is also further enhanced through blended learning strategies with the use of ICT tools, such as iPads, where students at their own pace could acquire or create new knowledge.  As part of inculcating the love and joy for learning, students have a voice in shaping the way they learn and we give them space to create and to tinker. We share their learning and creations proudly as we display their efforts in class and throughout the school.   In addition, the school designed numerous experiences to develop each child holistically and acquire strong fundamentals in literacy, numeracy, character, knowledge and 21st century competencies. Such experiences often take advantage of our close proximity to the Southern Ridges and Sentosa where we conduct trails for the public or provide entrepreneur opportunities as the children man stalls in Sentosa to raise funds for charity. Our children also have the opportunity to acquire digital media skills as they will be provided with digital cameras for photography and videography that will provide them with another medium of expression. Through our Programme for Active Learning, our children acquire social-emotional competencies to exercise better self-management and responsible decision making."
