		"School Mission": "To nurture every PL Lite into a whole person who lives in favour with God and man.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School (Primary) is a school with a strong Methodist heritage and history.  Two tenets: holistic development and character development form the foundation of learning at PL.   As espoused by the school philosophy and guided by our first tenet on holistic development, the school develops the girls into well-rounded, whole persons. At PL, we nurture our students in the cognitive, leadership, aesthetics, physical and social-moral domains. Besides exposing the students to varied learning experiences, this holistic development also helps the girls find their strengths and grow their interest. Aligned to our second tenet, character development, the school nurtures PL-Lites to become women after God's HEART - Honour God, Excellence Mindset, Adaptable, Respect and Thankful.   Undergirding these two tenets is the key emphasis on the use of experiential learning. PL teachers design authentic settings for learning so that our girls will grow to become Confident Leaders, Global Citizens and Creative Problem-solvers.  Together with the Board, Alumni, Parents and PLMGS (Sec), the school builds a strong culture which we name the PL Spirit. This PL Spirit fosters a strong school identity and safe learning environment which enable the girls to blossom as they grow under the care of their teachers and love of their peers.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "To support our tenet on holistic development, all our girls are engaged in two Lifelong Learning Programmes (LLP). The two LLP, 'Aesthetics Sports Experience @PL' and  'Music Harmonises @PL' provide dual opportunities for our girls to acquire skills in music, sports and dance as well as develop skills of collaboration and acquire the value of resilience.   In the first LLP, 'Aesthetics Sports Experience @PL', the girls participate in rope skipping, gymnastics and dance. The older girls at P5 and 6 also explore and discover their interest as they try their hand in a variety of sports and games at the Games Fiesta. For 'Music Harmonises @PL', the girls learn to play and perform with handbells, ukulele, angklung and recorder. Through these learning, the girls learn the importance of listening and waiting for their turn as they perform collaboratively with their peers. Incremental difficulty is built into the LLP learning experiences so that the girls develop perseverance and discipline as they work at mastering the skills in the sports and aesthetics.   At PL, we also believe in exposing the students to the world of work early. All the girls participate in the school's signature 'Step-In, Step-Out' Programme. Parents and alumni members from varied industries are invited to 'Step-In' to share their work experience with Primary 4 students. Then at Primary 5, the students deepen the learning as they 'Step-Out' into the work place of their parent.   Two key drivers of our character development programme are Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) and Values in Action Programme (VIA). There is a strong vibrant CCA culture as all girls participate actively in CCAs. All students also participate in VIA Programme as the school believes that 'no child is too young to serve'. Through their participation in CCA and VIA, the girls learn to practise and internalise the school values as they grow into women of fine character."
