		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "We believe that academic pursuits and character building are complementary in nature and equally important in the holistic development of our students.  Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), CAPtivate -Critical thinking Accelerated Programme @ UPS aims to promote reading, address linguistic fluency and comprehension. Elements of critical thinking are also infused in R.A.B.B.I.T (Read A Book Because It's Terrific), which is an important component of the programme.  The school is committed to promoting engaged learning and sound character development of our students. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) \"CharGE UP!' -(Character development through Green and Experiential learning @ Unity Primary) is designed with these in mind. Our I-Character programme is merged with Green@UPS, which is our environment initiative. This encapsulates our CCE efforts and they are the key drivers for the character development of our students.  We believe that learning beyond the classroom is important and opportunities are provided to our students to experience outdoor and overseas learning journeys. P4 students begin their outdoor education through the Adventure Camp at MOE Adventure Centres. The objectives of the camp experience are to foster in them resilience, ruggedness and a can-do spirit in challenging learning environments. Continuing the experience in P5, they participate in an overseas Learning Journey to Malaysia. This trip serves to inculcate values of team work, responsibility and a sense of independence with the focus on NE messages and citizenry. In P6, the learning continues with a 3-day camp with the focus on motivation, study skills and personal responsibility.  We have also incorporated CCA within curriculum time for all P3 to P6 students and at the heart of the Co-Curricular Programme is the development of values and character which is reinforced via circle time. All students belong to a CCA, reflecting our emphasis on CCAs as an integral part of holistic education."
