		"School Mission": "To nurture our students with a quality, holistic education, rooted in Christian values, that allows each to reach his fullest potential, equipped with life skills to face the future and to serve God and nation.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) (ACSJ) is one of the seven units in the ACS Family of Schools. Bishop William Fitzjames Oldham founded Anglo-Chinese School on 1 March 1886 in a humble shop house at 70 Amoy Street.   Today, the ACSian outcomes in the domains of Aspiration (The ACSian embraces the future with an aspiring mindset), Character (The ACSian Gentleman of Character demonstrates love, integrity and loyalty at all times), and Service (The ACSian works with others to make a positive difference) are based on Christian values, which still remain as a cornerstone in the school's vision aims to make \"Every ACSian, a young gentleman of character ready for the future to lead and to serve\".   The school provides a positive learning environment designed to stimulate the intellectual, social, physical, emotional and spiritual growth of the boys. Through a shared vision and understanding of the school's core values (Integrity, Love, Excellence, Curiosity, Collaboration & Loyalty) there is strong engagement of the boys and staff in teaching and learning in both the core and co-curricular programme.   Central to our success at providing a holistic education for our students is the strong partnership we enjoy with our stakeholders and institutions in the wider community. At ACSJ, boys are part of a community that values each person's individual self-worth. They engage in meaningful activities while fostering firm friendships and ties that will last a lifetime.  We believe that under our nurturing environment, and being amongst a caring and congenial community of staff, students, parents and alumni, a student's primary years with us will be both fulfilled and meaningful. Our students will leave the school as confident young gentlemen, ready to move on to greater heights in their next stage in life for above all they stand by our motto: The Best Is Yet To Be.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Various school programmes support the development of the 3 desired outcomes in each ACSian - the ACSian embraces the future with an aspring mindset; the ACSian gentleman demonstrates love, integrity and loyalty at all times; the ACSian works with others to make a positive difference.   In Character & Citizenship Education, the planned curriculum and the informal help students to develop CCE competencies. The Values in Action Programme (VIA) at ACSJ is a platform of practice for the school values, traits and social emotional competencies taught and shared. Through the programmes, students are actively engaged in the community, deriving learning through the service they render. As values are both caught and taught, the school provides many opportunities such as 'Greet. Ask. Thank.' and 'Everyday Responsibilities' for our boys to demonstrate school values in and out of the classrooms.   ACSJ's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) comprises Creative Thinkers for all which develop the 21st Century Skills Domains of Learning & Innovation skills, Information, Media & Technology skills and Life & Career Skills. In Creative Thinkers, students are engaged through purposeful play of quality games and Creative Problem Solving (CPS) activities deployed in the classroom. Additional support to the Academic Programme is provided through the Thoburn and Hinch Programmes, which seek to develop intellectual rigour, creativity and character values in students of all abilities.  ACSJ also offers a Learning for Life Programme (LLP) titled 'All for Sports, Sports for All @ ACSJ'. It features key sports such as tennis, rugby, table tennis and swimming to promote a pervasive sporting culture. By leveraging on the existing platforms of PAL, PE and CCA, as well as existing school sports events, Holistic Health Programme and Play@Recess programmes, the school provides many avenues to nurture values as well as life skills whilst providing a firm basis for a healthy & active lifestyle."
