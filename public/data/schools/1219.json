We aim to systematically equip our students with the 21st Century competencies and develop into  a confident person, a self-directed learner, a concerned citizen and an active contributor.  This is the shared aspiration and responsibility of all staff.   The School Beliefs We believe  - all students want to learn and can learn, though they may learn differently. - having high expectations of all our students, providing them with opportunities and support are the foundations for progress. - teachers make a difference. - quality teaching contributes to good student discipline (in learning and behaviour), and that good discipline contributes to quality teaching and learning. - in teamwork and collaboration. - a holistic education best prepares our students for the future.

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school has two distinctive programmes outside the core curriculum to provide all students with more varied and authentic learning opportunities:   1. Project ACTIVAtE is a structured programme designed to facilitate a progressive values based learning process that involves students applying knowledge & skills to real life situations based on themes and concepts. It incorporates Values-in-Action which is an important component in our Character and Citizenship education that harnesses pupils' sense of ownership, teamwork & proactivity in self-initiating purposeful projects that will make a difference to others.  The highlight of this programme is the incorporation of a design thinking protocol which allows the pupils to go through in-depth inquiry, engage in a rigorous process of asking questions and utilize relevant resources to meet the needs of the beneficiaries.  This programme strives to develop our pupils to have a deep sense care and belonging to the community.  2. I3QUEST aims to develop critical & creative thinking skills through progressive and developmental programme focused on computational thinking and the use of creative computing tools.  Pupils acquire the skills of logic, sequencing and create projects through the use of programming & coding tool kits.  In this learning process, pupils are developed in 21st century competencies, problems solving skills & facilitated collaborative learning.    Another key programme in the school is the Integrated Outdoor Learning Experience programme whereby subject integration is structured across Primary 1 to 6. It is anchored by the English curriculum and integrated with other subjects across the 6 levels. The pupils are actively engaged in posing questions, being curious & constructing meaning throughout the learning experience. A key facet of this outdoor learning is the authentic experiential learning across subject disciplines supported by exciting ICT applications."
