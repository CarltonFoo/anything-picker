Teachers exercise the duty of care and professionalism in teaching and learning to develop students to their fullest potential. Our staff are collegial and collaborative, working collectively and interdependently towards common goals for continuous improvement and excellence. With the focus on developing staff capacity to enhance professional competencies, we journeyed into Professional Learning Teams as an avenue for teacher collaboration to meet the learning needs of students and improve student outcomes. Teachers enhance their pedagogical capacity and instructional competency through teacher training in instructional strategies and reflective practices. The Instructional Programme (IP) Departments are empowered to experiment with practices that will promote more engaged learning. East Spring Secondary strives to develop every student's ability and talent to the fullest to benefit the self, community and nation. We prepare our students for the 21st century by cultivating innovation and creativity, as well as competencies such as leadership, team working skills and cross cultural literacy. Through these programmes, East Spring provides diverse experiences for all-round development of its students. Our students will emerge as creative learners, upright citizens and global thinkers. The expectations set for the staff and students are best expressed with the tagline Aim High, Act Now, encapsulating the school belief that much can be achieved with the right values of R3ISE, Excel and Innovate.",
