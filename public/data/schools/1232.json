		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "In Lianhua, we believe that school should not just be about academic excellence. To better prepare our students for a future that is more dynamic and complex, we must focus on the all-round development of students, and equip them with the skills, attitudes and values to be future-ready - Students who will grow into confident citizens who chart their own paths and create their own successes.  Our school vision is Hearts of Service, Minds of Inquiry, Joy in Learning, Confidence in Life.  Through 'Hearts of Service', we want to nurture our students to be caring and compassionate towards others, to know that regardless of their circumstance, they can do their part to make a difference to the people around them.  'Minds of Inquiry' is about seeking knowledge and learning to think creatively and critically which is an important 21st century competency. We want our students to be curious about the world and things around them. Learning is no longer something that just takes place in school. During this time, where change is happening so rapidly, our hope is for our students to find 'Joy in Learning' and to continue to learn throughout life.  We want out students to grow up to be useful and contributing citizens who are confident and have a strong belief in their self-worth. Thus, 'Confidence in Life'.  Our school mission is Together we bring out the best in every child for a better nation.  Together is important as it is our belief that the school cannot do it alone. We must establish strong partnerships with Parents and the Community to bring up every child together. Every child is unique with their own interests, talents and aspirations, and we want to bring out the best in every child, to guide and nurture them to their fullest potential. Our PISA (Physical, Intellectual, Social-moral & Aesthetics) framework guides us to create all-round quality school experiences for our students and to nurture their talents in their pursuit of being the best they can be.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our LLP, Values in Action through Sports aims to nurture students into engaged learners who adopt a healthy lifestyle and develop joy in learning; contributing team players who contribute by serving others and promoting teamwork; and confident leaders who display self-confidence and leadership. Through Sports, experiences are created for students to put our school values into action. For students who excelled, their passion and skills are honed in our Sports Talent Management Programme. Our ALP, RITE@Lianhua (Robotics,Info-Technology Education) takes an integrated approach for students to learn 21CC skills in Critical and Inventive Thinking, Info-tech Literacy and Communication. Through RITE, students experience and develop their interest and aptitude for Coding and Robotics. Our school is piloting the National Junior Coding Standards to accredit students' coding skills to provide them with insights on their progression. We believe that 'Every Student Can Lead' and thus provide opportunities for every student to become an Empowered Leader who lives out our school vision 'Hearts of Service'. In-house training is conducted to equip students with the skills to lead self and others in service to the school and to the community. A signature programme in the Aesthetics domain in our Young Composers Programme. Students are guided to compose songs about values and friendship that shape the Lianhua identity. It also complements our efforts to create a singing culture in our school as we believe that singing is a natural, creative and powerful way to engage students in learning about values and life. The Young Explorer Scientist (YES!) Programme shows our strong emphasis on engaging students to appreciate and be excited about nature. With our vast resource of gardens, animal enclosures and ponds in the school, students learn Science in an authentic and fun way, being up close with nature. Also weaved into the curriculum are our fish breeding and indoor hydroponics programmes."
