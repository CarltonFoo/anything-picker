		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school builds a strong foundation in our pupils through its programmes that hinge on Joy of Learning and Continual Improvement.  -To better engage pupils in their cognitive development, the school has designed Authentic Learning Experiences to meet their needs, interests and abilities. These include Fun Learning Programmes in all subjects such as Inquiry-Based Science lessons and customised trails.  - Developing Oracy Skills and Teaching Physical Science and Math Concepts Through Building Blocks. \"YZPS Legoland\" focuses on using building blocks to instil fun in learning the English Language, with alignment to STELLAR. Drama strategies were infused to provide a platform for teachers and pupils to generate, select and organise ideas for speaking and writing.  The school also uses building blocks in the teaching of physical Science and Math to provide pupils with experiential learning experiences for better understanding of concepts.  - We believe that Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Programmes is the key in shaping our pupils holistically. CCE is integrated into our curricular and co-curricular programmes to better engage pupils in values learning. It includes Values in Action Programme and our school's Learning for Life Programme - Leadership and Life Skills through Uniformed Groups where pupils are developed in character, lifeskills and leadership.   - E3 (Explore, Engage and Experience) Day is a whole school approach on customised learning journeys (LJ) that aim to promote experiential learning through fun and meaningful activities.  Mobile learning is incorporated to develop Self-directed Learning and Collaborative Learning Skills in pupils. Performance Tasks through Social Studies serves as an extension to the pupils' learning acquired at the LJ.   - The school promotes a whole-school approach to Healthy Living. Fun Friday mass exercise and FruiTime that aims to encourage pupils to eat fruits as part of their daily diet are organised."
