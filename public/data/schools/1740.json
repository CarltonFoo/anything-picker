		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "To augment the holistic development of our pupils through the national curriculum, the school offers its own distinctive programmes which focus on the pupils' development in metacognition, character, leadership and lifeskills.   Metacognitive developmental programmes are organised through a broad-based approach to develop our pupils into well-cultivated and critical thinkers. This includes the learning of programming concepts through Robotics and investigative problem-solving skills through our Spatial Visualisation programme. Critical thinking skills are taught through International Chess while pupils learn and develop a problem-solving thinking disposition through the integration of Future Problem Solving 6-steps protocol and Project Work.   Besides explicit teaching and reflective learning of values, character development opportunities are created for our pupils through our unique Traditional Arts Character Development programme. Through Calligraphy and Chinese Brush Painting, pupils internalise and deepen their understanding of values while engaging in the respective traditional art forms.    The school has a structured leadership programme to develop confident and self-directed individuals with a servant leadership disposition. All pupils undergo a school-based personal leadership programme in their 6 years with the school. Skills-based development programmes are further mounted for different segments of student leaders to equip them for their functional roles and leadership.   To help our students deepen their dispositions for lifelong learning, our LLP, \"Every Pupil a Confident Performer\", provides broad-based exposure to the Performing Arts. Our pupils learn progressive skill sets to build up their confidence and poise, such as body movement, gestures, speech and song on stage through a mix of curricular and co-curricular activities. The 6-year development programme culminates in a musical put up by our Primary 6 classes."
