We strive to achieve the Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE) - Primary Schools, while developing the social-emotional competencies of our pupils.   As Anthonians, we care for everyone, regardless of race, language or religion, and we are passionate about developing as many aspects of ourselves as possible.

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "To achieve our Mission and Vision, the required competencies, skills and attitudes are inculcated in our pupils through key programmes such as:  Living Well values education programme The Living Well programme focuses on helping pupils understand how to live a meaningful life through the Living Well lessons and through related programmes and planned activities.  Built around a range of activities, the weekly Living Well lessons enable pupils to explore the meaning of the school values, social and emotional skills as well as their role as a member of communities. All pupils attend the Living Well lessons, with Catholic pupils participating in a pull-out programme that delivers the core content with a Catholic focus.   Learning for Life Programme 1 (LLP1): Visual Arts Programme for Active Learning  The Visual Arts programme in SAPS caters to both the general pupil population and those passionate about art, and its objectives are to increase pupils' exposure to the arts; to equip pupils with the skills to appreciate the visual arts; and to enhance the range of forms pupils use to express their ideas. Pupils focus on skill acquisition and the expression of their creativity to create art pieces during Art lessons. Those passionate about Art extend their learning through membership in the Art Club CCA and participation in a multi-aged Art Elective Programme.  In line with the emphasis on values inculcation, the Visual Arts programme also integrates the teaching of values into its curriculum.   Learning for Life Programme 2 (LLP2): LEARN.PLAY.GROW - 'Developing Character through Sports' Programme  Complementing the existing character development programme, Learn.Play.Grow extends ways in which pupils can learn values through sports. The Programme exposes pupils to a wide range of sports so as to motivate them to be either competitive players, recreational players or even appreciative spectator. The school is in the midst of fully implementing the programme."
