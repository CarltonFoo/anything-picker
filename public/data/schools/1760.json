		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Approved and endorsed by MOE since 2014, the school leverages its Applied Learning Programme(E3 Reasoning) and Learning for Life Programme(Outdoor Education) to nurture holistic learners who are New-World Ready.  E3 Reasoning Concord places a premium on enabling them to think, discern and make informed decisions in life. Our E3 Reasoning is a unique initiative which aims to Enable, Enrich and Empower our students to analyse, infer, draw conclusions and generate new understanding based on Learner-Centred Pedagogy. Students are taught to rationalize and think visibly through our customized weekly lessons with progressive games, problem solving scenarios, Experiential Learning and Teachable Moments. The school has mapped out a progressive 6-year milestones plan to guide the delivery and attainment of the intended outcomes. As our students learn in fun ways, they also acquire the essential skills which will provide them with a good start in their journey ahead.  Outdoor Education Anchored on Gilbertson's OE Model and Longfellow's Outdoor Pedagogies, our curriculum offers opportunities for students to explore and apply skills learnt in an authentic environment. Our comprehensive curriculum is organised under 5 broad-based domains(Discovery, Sports, Nature, Camp and Training), which reinforces the development of values and character. Our students will learn skills such as navigation and tent-pitching and undergo Simulated Caving Experience, Rock Climbing and Kayaking, and are well placed to develop ruggedness, resilience, confidence and a heightened sense of appreciation and awareness for the environment. Students will learn to navigate, abseil independently and appreciate nature via carefully planned activities throughout their journey in the school.  As a place for purposeful learning that equips students for the future, Concord is a choice school for all aspiring children. Caring Hearts, Enriched Minds and Determined Spirits - that's the hallmark of Concordians!"
