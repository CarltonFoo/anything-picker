Our motto \"Grow and Glow\" is an aspiration that as the school grows, it will glow in the community as a school of distinction.    We believe in nurturing the whole child by guiding our students to develop their moral, emotional, social, cognitive, aesthetic and physical (MESCAP) domains to the fullest so that they will become persons of character who are good and useful citizens of tomorrow.

We believe that we can do so by building a culture of care and learning in the school.  We provide a caring climate for our students to grow through positive teacher-student relationship and restorative practice to manage good behaviour and peer relationship.  We design a rigorous and sound school-based curriculum to foster the joy of learning and the drive for lifelong learning.  To further develop our students' talent and interest, our students are provided opportunities to experience the following key programmes, namely, creativity and play-based learning, outdoor education, and student life and leadership programme.

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Living Out our Values Every day (LOVE@PGVP) We believe that values are caught and not just taught. The school values are taught during our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons and reinforced through our school-based programmes.  Students are taught to reflect on their actions on a Value Card and teachers will endorse the card upon the successful completion of the observable behaviours or actions. The students could be rewarded with a value badge. We hope by so doing, our students will live out these values as habits for life  Learning for Life Programme - Outdoor Education   We believe firmly that Outdoor Education (OE) is a good opportunity to develop ruggedness and resilience in our students. Hence, the school has put in place a comprehensive Learning for Life Programme (LLP) on Outdoor Education. This allows students to work in teams and collaborate with their peers to build character, evoke their curiosity about nature, and develop a feeling of wanting to protect the environment via Values in Action. In the process, our students will learn to navigate, assess risks and make decisions about their own safety and wellbeing, while enjoying the outdoors.  These are essential life skills and values that we hope to develop in our students.   Creative LEGO Our signature Creative LEGO ensures that our students acquire the learning outcomes of Confidence, Curiosity and Collaboration through a series of art-related experiences such as PAL. Students will acquire an appreciation for sculpture building as well as develop skills in aesthetics and creativity.  Through generating ideas creatively in groups and responding to issues and challenges, our students would develop 21st century competencies such as collaboration and communicating effectively.  Most importantly, our students will enjoy the learning through active engagement with the element of fun."
