		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Pei Hwa, with its long history in serving the community, pride ourselves in providing our students with a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) focused education through our signature Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Robotics & Programming, which includes LEGO EV3 technology training, Co-Space Robotics Competitions (collaboration with Singapore Polytechnic), Science and Engineering Electives and Advanced Elective Modules (with other Polytechnics) and Internship with Newcastle University International. This emphasis on developing the 21st Century Competencies could also be seen in our \"Learning For Life Programme: Community Youth Leadership\" (LLP: CYL), which commits our students to Values-In-Action (VIA) activities to develop their spirit of altruism through learning about community issues, initiating actions to make a difference and reflecting on the values and life-skills learnt. Pei Hwa's curriculum is also anchored upon the Experiential Education (EE) Framework, which focuses on making learning an engaging and enriching experience for every student, even beyond the classrooms. For example, through the school's School-Based Curriculum Innovation (SCI), students conducted inter-disciplinary research projects in diverse Singapore's contexts such as Sengkang West Estate, Tiong Bahru's heritage sites, Army Museum. Through our Special Learning Spaces such as the Solar Learning Centre and Mobile Planetarium, students also get to discover the application of scientific theories in authentic and real settings. The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
