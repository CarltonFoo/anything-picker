	"Centre Details": "Ichiban Montessori is dedicated to the education of children in an environment designed to stimulate and develop the child?s love for learning. Everything that occurs within our pre-schools will be aimed at achieving this underlying philosophy.\nIchiban Montessori aims to provide a dynamic, independent learning environment that is hands-on and student-driven for children ages 2 to 6 years old. Children develop inner-discipline, a love of learning, and learn at their own pace guided by the Montessori technique, which promotes individual initiative and creativity. We want our students to experience such a positive impact on their learning that our parents would never consider having them attend pre-school anywhere else!",
