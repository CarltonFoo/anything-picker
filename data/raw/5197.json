Our LLP aims to provide all students a structured performing arts programme in a vibrant and conducive environment. Additional learning platforms are provided for talented students to excel. The LLP not only develops in students an appreciation for the arts, it also lays a strong foundation for character development and skills essential for lifelong learning.  Project Hope - Aligned with the school's strategic objective to develop students with moral values and social and community spirit, NAPS' structured Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes nurture the students to be active contributors to society.  The VIA platforms provide authentic learning opportunities for students to internalise and develop the school core values of Commitment, Resilience, Respect and Integrity. Project Hope is the school's key VIA.  The graduating cohort spearheads Project Hope, a home-school-community-wide collaboration that assists less privileged families living in the Marine Terrace vicinity.  Through this endeavour, the school aims to develop compassion in students and provide them an opportunity to put into action all the values they have learnt during their six years in NAPS."
