		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Since 2014, the school initiated the Building Learning Power approach to integrate character education and academic learning. Through the direct instruction of learning dispositions, students acquire good habits and values. This enables the students to learn better and instil good character in them, preparing them to face difficulty and uncertainty calmly and confidently in the future. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - \"Building a Smart Home with a Big Heart\" aims for students to learn about the science of SMART Technologies, and understand its application in a SMART home system. Students will be required to propose innovative ways on how the safety and security of the elderly can be monitored and improved. This exemplifies the values-driven education of our school to enable students to promote a keen interest in the nation's development towards a more vibrant and caring society for generations to come. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - \"Learning Through the Arts\" aims to develop students' appreciation for various art forms. Students will have opportunities to experience arts as audience and participants and develop an interest and appreciation for the arts. The school started a Taipei Exchange Programme in 2015 to develop students global awareness and cross-cultural skills. There is also Reading Programme to inculcate good reading habits. With these programmes in place, our students are developed holistically and ready to take on challenges in life."
