		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In alignment to its school's vision, 'A Concerned Leader, A Lifelong Learner', the school seeks to create a learning community to help our pupils excel holistically with a key focus to develop its pupils aesthetically. A comprehensive school-wide programme and achievements in the Performing Arts led the school to be recognised as a MOE Learning for Life Programme (LLP) School in Music Education and Performing Arts, and the N7 Cluster Centre of Learning in Music. Pupils are given many opportunities to perform in front of an audience through the termly music competitions or exhibit their artworks publicly. They are groomed to become confident performers to showcase their talents at various platforms such as class competitions and Art Jam sessions during recess. The Fuchun Home Skills Programme is a signature programme in the CCE curriculum. This programme comprises lessons on basic cooking and sewing skills which are pitched according to the pupils' readiness, motor skills and interests. Through this programme, pupils learn to be independent and self-reliant. The seamless integration of English, Math and Science in the Home Skills Programme provides pupils with opportunities to experience authentic learning beyond the classroom. Pupils are able to revisit or learn concepts through hands-on activities. The school believes that every pupil has the capability to lead by positively influencing oneself and others through his or her thoughts, words and actions. Every pupil is given the chance to take up a leadership role in the school's bid to develop concerned leaders. The school developed a two-tiered leadership development framework which consists of cohort and locus leadership development. The former focuses on the development of personal leadership skills in every pupil while the latter develops specific leadership skills for student leaders to hone. With these programmes, the school strives to nurture concerned leaders, and lifelong learners in every of its pupils."
