		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Learning for Life Programme 1-Modular Co-Curricular Activities The school's LLP1 focuses on the development of 21st century competencies through Co-Curricular Activity modules. In addition to the core CCA module, students take part in elective CCA modules that cover the aesthetics, sports and intellectual domains. Over 6 years, students acquire both depth of learning in their core CCA module as well as exposure to other co-curricular activities that allow them to develop new skills and discover other interest areas.  Learning for Life Programme 2-Thinking Art The school's LLP2 provides students with a strong foundation in art and equips them with a progression of skills from the different art genres. In Media Art, students create their art work using ICT software and in the process build their confidence to navigate digital media. At a higher level, they learn to create their own thematic videos, involving skills like brainstorming, scriptwriting, storyboarding, filming and editing. In Recycling Art, students work with simple 2D forms before progressing to 3D forms or sculptures. This process nurtures their aesthetics awareness and helps them reflect on the purpose, meaning and process of art making. Through Thinking Art, students develop competencies like perseverance, self-discipline, self-awareness and at a higher level, critical and inventive thinking.  Project E-CHAMPS Through Project E-Champs, students acquire 21st century competencies in an authentic learning environment. Using the Problem-Based Learning approach, students work collaboratively to explore a real-life situation and in the process develop their competencies in devising a creative proposal to the problem.  Character and Citizenship Education through geNEsis The school's core CCE programme, geNEsis, emphasises g: games, e: experiential learning, NE: National Education, s: service, i: integrated lessons, s: student leadership. It is anchored on the 'Knowing', 'Doing' and 'Believing' framework."
