We are also exploring the feasibility to build a tree- house to double up as an outdoor classroom. \n\nCoupled with the integrated Multiple Intelligences (MI) curriculum developed by renowned educational psychologist, Dr Howard Gardner (Harvard University), Carpe Diem @ Hilltop is set to be the best start to your child's lifelong learning journey.\n\nWith a reliable reputation that has earned us the Superbrands award for three consecutive years (2004, 2005 and 2006), Singapore Prestige Brand Award in 2009, rest assured that Carpe Diem is Your Partner in Your Child's Development.
