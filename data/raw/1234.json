In our efforts to nurture the children entrusted in our care, we offer a student-centric, values-driven education that helps our students to enjoy coming to school, pursue their passions and succeed. We focus on every child and value their special talents, abilities, interests and learning needs. Through the learning experiences in our school, all our students will develop into Active learners(students who are always learning and doing their best in any situation), Dynamic leaders (Not just leaders but useful people in their own right who contribute to making a difference in all they do) and Enterprising citizens (be socially responsible people making Singapore proud. Have a global perspective and be outward looking.)  All Balesterians are guided by the 5 core values embedded in the acronym HELIX: Honour being our hallmark, Resilience our spirit, Love our culture, Innovation our anchor and, eXcellence our commitment. Just like the double helix in the DNA of our cells, the Core values define our school and are the foundation values for every child in the school.  They will guide the child daily and be the moral compass in his/her decision-making process.    The school Motto is our Acronym BHPS; Believing, Harnessing, Progressing, Surpassing. The school strongly believes in continuously improving ourselves so that we will surpass our own expectations and potential.   We believe strongly in innovation and the school theme \"New Ideas; Infinite Possibilities\" signals to everyone that innovation is a key skill to develop if we want our students to excel in the new uncertain and globalized world. Our students need to learn to be resilient and adaptable to seize opportunities for success.",
