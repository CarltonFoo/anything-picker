Our LLP, HE'ARTS@CAPS, which stands for Holistic Education through the ARTS at Casuarina Primary School, aims to provide students with a holistic education through the school's arts programme. Our LLP serves to develop students in creativity and expression. Through targeted learning experiences, HE'ARTS@CAPS also promotes inter-ethnic bonding and the appreciation of our cultural heritage, thus cultivating a sense of national pride and identity.     The schools ALP, The Art of Language, aims to develop in students, the essential competencies of the literary arts as well as confidence in self-expression through a whole-school approach that is progressive and developmental. The Art of Language also aims to develop students to be effective communicators and critical and inventive thinkers, as well as to provide them with platforms for global and cross-cultural awareness. The Art of Language lends itself perfectly well in achieving these desired outcomes for the Casuarinian student. The knowledge, skills and experiences derived from The Art of Language can be applied and extended to the other areas of the students' growth, e.g., articulating thoughts and ideas in CCE, Music and Art."
