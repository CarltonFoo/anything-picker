		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Students benefit from the school's holistic education which is designed to provide a rigorous and engaging academic curriculum as well as develop students' character through the various CCAs and the Service Learning programme. Bowen challenges students to do well academically, while providing opportunities for them to be fully engaged in learning through creative programmes such as LifeLit, a drama-infused language arts programme for Lower Secondary students. The school's strong CCA culture provides a well-balanced and comprehensive co-curricular programme that helps the students to grow into well-rounded individuals. Under the school's Community Youth Leaders (CYL) programme, community service is offered as a platform for students to inspire, and be inspired, by engaging in service to others. The school was accorded the Community Youth Leadership pilot school status by the National Youth Council, as well as the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) status by MOE in 2014. The school's Social Entrepreneurship Programme (SEP) seeks to nurture creativity, encourage a spirit of enterprise and build empathy, thus preparing students to be entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs in the future. The SEP teaches students to use the tools of Design Thinking to approach challenges and opportunities to create suitable solutions. The school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) status in 2016. The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
