		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects.  The school runs two distinctive school programmes in the Applied Learning Programme entitled \"Real Food, Real Science\" and the Learning for Life Programme entitled \"Active Glocal Citizens\". The Real Food, Real Science Programme is customised for different courses and allows our students to apply the skills they learnt in investigative experiences in Food Science to create healthier food and/or provide services in the Food and Beverage Industry. Two signature modules in Basic Science Research and Hub Cafe@WDL nurture our students to become creative problem solvers. The Active Glocal Citizens Programme provides training in social innovation and entrepreneurship at lower secondary level with local Values-in-Action as the context for application. It culminates in Secondary 3 when our students apply the skills in the cohort overseas Values-in-Action expeditions to ASEAN countries. The programme aspires to prepare our students to be future contributors in the form of community youth leaders. Follow us on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/woodlandssecondarysch) or our Instagram account @woodlandssec for up-to-date information on the learning experiences of our students."
