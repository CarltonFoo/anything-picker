		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) is in Environmental Education (EE). Through this, pupils are exposed to progressive level-appropriate learning of EE issues integrated with the learning of leadership skills, values and community involvement. The school has embarked on a concerted effort to design for active learning involving deep thinking and collaborative learning supported by ICT. It is currently working with educational partners on a project called \"Making the Invisible Visible In Science (MIVIS)\" where collaborative and inquiry-learning pedagogical approaches are used in P3 Science lessons supported by the provision of mobile devices. Through the project, which will be scaled to other levels and subjects, the school hopes to strengthen 21st century competencies in students. A differentiated and targeted approach is adopted to help pupils with various learning profiles. High-progress pupils go through enrichment programmes such as Literature Alive and Maths Stretch. Pupils with learning difficulties and special needs are assisted by Remediation, Reading Remediation Programme (RRP), School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR), Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) programme, AED-supported pull-outs and Morning Extensive Reading. PERI Holistic Assessment approaches have become de rigueur at P1 to P6 levels, providing timely and useful feedback for students to work on improvement areas. The school also organises a Mid-Year Student-led Parent-Teacher Conferencing to enable students to reflect on and communicate their progress to parents. To allow students to explore learning beyond their textbooks, the school organises Inter-Disciplinary Project Work for the P5 and P6 students. These are intentionally linked to the school's LLP of EE and our CCE intent to make students socially responsible. Students explore ways to reuse and recycle materials and use them at the Annual FIESTA Carnival to raise funds for charitable organisations."
