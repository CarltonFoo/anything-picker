		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "I. Curriculum Enhancement: BMSS students have performed well in Mathematics and Science.  This has been the result of teachers exploring new pedagogy and stretching student capacity through curricular enrichment activities. Examples of these include the use of 3D Media for the teaching of Science and Interactive SMART boards in Mathematics. Our students participate annually in University of New South Wales International Competition for Mathematics & Science, Singapore Mathematics Olympiads, workshops at Singapore Science Centre and Advanced Elective Modules (Clean Energy, Polymer Science) at local polytechnics.  The school also champions reading literacy. In collaboration with the National Library Board, we have embarked on a whole-school effort to promote reading as a habit among students. II. Co-Curricular Initiatives: To develop 21st century competencies, we have distinctive programmes including (1) Applied Learning through use of Digital Media to tackle authentic real-life problems; (2) Merahan Leadership Challenge: a student-led event to plan and execute a one-day out-of-school curriculum with a national education thematic focus for their respective classes; (3) Experiential Learning Programme: leveraging outdoor education to build peer relationships and inculcate values; (4) Aesthetics Education: series of visual and performing arts workshops conducted for one level of students that culminates in an end-of-term performance; (5) Character Development through Sports (e.g. Floorball).  This serves as a key platform to develop life-skills by promoting teamwork, self-discipline and the pursuit of excellence.  All students will be taught team sports during PE lessons and their skills are developed progressively at the different levels."
