The ALP focusses on equipping students with essential skills and knowledge of business and entrepreneurship including ICT and Design Thinking tools and marketing and presentation skills through level wide programmes such as Elective Modules, Advance Elective Modules and Values in Action. The LLP aims to develop leadership skills progressively in all students; beginning with personal and community leadership and culminating in executive leadership. All students will acquire basic leadership competencies, social emotional skills and values to become community leaders.  The programme utilises carefully selected tools including 7 Habits of Effective Teens, National Youth Achievement Award, experiential outdoor learning and leadership profiling tools.  It will also leverage the current strength of the school in Uniformed Groups (UGs) to provide UG experiences for non-UG students.  In all, the school is committed to nurturing learners with skills and values to innovate and gracious citizens with the heart to serve."
