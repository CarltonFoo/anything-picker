As a school, we put the child at the centre of all we do as we strive to cater to the needs of our pupils and develop them holistically. We offer a rigorous academic curriculum that is complemented by a comprehensive and values-driven co-curricular programme. Taken collectively, both aim to equip our pupils with the necessary skills, attributes and 21st century competencies to not only survive but thrive when they leave school.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "We aim to raise our daughters of Marymount by developing them cognitively, physically, socially and morally to be future-ready. Some of our school's signature programmes are outlined below:  Our school's Learning for Life Programme (Sports & Outdoor Education) ia aimed at developing pupils who are healthy in mind, body and soul. It encompasses a coherent PE curriculum over 6 years that offers Educational Gymnastics for all pupils, camps and outdoor learning activities such as trekking and water-based activities during the Week for Experiential Learning (WELL), as well as ensuring that pupils' interests are catered to and enhancing the capacity of those with identified talents through the various sports CCAs.  Our school's niche in Aesthetics sees a distinctive arts programme, the STAR programme, that permeates the whole school community. It plays a critical role in nurturing ladies who are refined and cultured and in developing pupils holistically in the 21st century competencies. An immersive and engaging Art and Music programme within curriculum time, coupled with Arts LJs (eg Esplanade and Singapore Art Museum) in the school's signature WELL programme, aesthetics modules in PAL and events such as the Arts Fest and Arts Week, lend to a coherent 6-year curriculum and a vibrant arts culture and environment in the school.  With the strong focus on values at Marymount, the school's Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Programme takes centrestage in the curriculum. The school's Values Education (VE) and Catholic Values Education (CVE) programmes run parallel and focus more on the teaching and inculcation of the 8 school values over 6 years."
