		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's Applied Learning Programme aims to develop Effective Communicators, Caring Leaders and Inventive Thinkers through a 3-year Communication Skills Programme. Through this programme, students develop deep analytical and critical thinking skills, collaborative skills and oratorical skills through Effective Reading, Debates and Presentations. Talent development programmes such as the Model United Nations, e-Journalism and the Odyssey of the Mind Competition, allow students to further hone their interest. The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is a 4/5-year programme that focuses on Strengthening Resilience, Character and Leadership through Sports Education. With this programme, the school aims to nurture all students to become thinking and caring leaders who take personal responsibility for maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle. Students will be exposed to a broad-based PE curriculum and authentic applications of lessons on resilience and leadership through outdoor programmes, CCA and partnerships with external agencies. To nurture community engagement, the school has a comprehensive Sec 1-4 Service Learning structure. This approach empowers students to participate in learning experiences that are tailored to levels to internalise values, sharpen leadership skills and develop critical thinking competencies. The school also offers a structured Science and Technology Research Programme (STRP) to stretch the potential of our students, by providing them with opportunities to work on research projects under the guidance of dedicated teachers. This equips them with research skills, analytical skills and presentation skills."
