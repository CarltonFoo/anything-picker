		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Talent Management Our talent management model aims to identify, develop and hone the academic and non-academic talents of our students. In so doing, the school strives to help them build confidence and cultivate a drive to succeed.  Effective Communicators We aim to develop Cedarians who are able to think independently and critically, and communicate effectively. Our in-house Effective Communication curriculum aims to develop students' ability to communicate effectively both in writing and speaking, and to exercise sound reasoning, decision-making and metacognition.  Creative Thinkers Our Applied Learning Programme, Creative and Inventive Thinking, is a 6-year programme where we aim to develop our students' learning attitude and thinking skills while honing their capacity for higher-order thinking and equipping them with a problem-solving mind-set. Students who demonstrated interest and aptitude are invited to join our Future Innovators' Programme where they are given opportunities to further enhance their thinking skills at platforms beyond the school.  Upstanding Leaders Our student leaders are called \"Upstanding Leaders\"- \"upstanding\" because they metaphorically and literally stand up for and advocate what is right; \"leaders\" because we believe that with training, all our students are able to awaken and realise their leadership potential. We aim to strengthen the moral fibre in our students by teaching them not only to be model students but also to be role models for others in both word and action.  Active Contributors The various platforms in CCE and students' programmes aim to equip students with the abilities and skills to contribute positively to school initiatives such as VIA, Environmental Education and Student Suggestion Scheme. Through these initiatives, we hope to strengthen the students' social awareness by increasing their knowledge of community issues, strengths and resources which will help them to develop understanding of the wider community."
