		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "We strive to inculcate 'integrity, compassion and the desire to learn and bless others' as we build an engaging school to develop all-round students through an empowered staff. Our approach to Character Development is anchored in 'Knowing', 'Doing' and 'Being', and we aim to equip every student with social and emotional competencies and root them in moral values. The school is guided by the principle of 'Building Character through Building Relationships' as we believe that a strong student-teacher bond is pivotal to sound character formation. We encourage our students to be in the position of choice i.e. to be of good character, succeeding in both academic and affective areas, so that more life opportunities would be opened to them. We do this by offering choices to our students, because we value and acknowledge that each individual has different talents and needs. The school's academic programmes are therefore customised to meet students' needs and abilities, stimulate thinking and inspire learning.",
