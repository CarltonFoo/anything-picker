		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school has 5 Key Programmes to achieve our vision for Frontierers:  Frontier's Approach to Communicating Effectively (F@CE) aims to develop our pupils to have effective communication and critical thinking skills, so that they can articulate their knowledge, ideas and thinking clearly and confidently while displaying school values.  Thinking Silhouette is a customised thinking model that helps the school realise our vision of developing our pupils into 'Confident Thinkers'. Each thinking silhouette is a profile of one facet of a person's thinking.   Restorative Practices is the school's approach to inculcate a culture of care and restorative relationships in the school. Frontierers will understand the importance of making responsible personal choices that positively affect their relationships. They are also taught to understand that they have the power to contribute towards building a positive environment.  danceFRONT is the school's approach to deliver Dance and Performing Arts education to Frontierers. The school believes that dance and performing arts develop self-esteem and confidence of participants, as well as self-management from the listening and concentration required during the activity.  exemplary Leaders@Frontier (eLF) aims to harness the leadership potential and develop the leadership skills in every child by providing each with relevant opportunities and training. The core beliefs of eLF are that leadership can be taught and learned, is a developmental process, is a collective activity, and is rooted in service."
