		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "An Autonomous School, St. Margaret's delivers an all-round education and has distinctive Cognitive, Arts, Sports and Student Leadership programmes to develop and hone student talents. With a rich heritage as the oldest girls' school in the Far East, we receive strong support from the stakeholder community. Our partners' contributions range from securing established professionals and volunteering themselves for the Professional Guidance Day and Assembly Speaker Series to inspire our students and provide them with career guidance, to offering them placements for their Work Attachment Programme. Our students achieve academic excellence through a rigorous curriculum that adopts a pedagogical framework utilising elements of Understanding by Design and Critical Thinking to deepen student understanding and encourage inventive thinking; online platforms and school-developed mobile apps further enhance the learning experience. All students are developed in leadership skills and dispositions through a tiered leadership programme and are coached by their teachers to guide their growth. As the S6 Cluster Centre of Excellence for Visual & Performing Arts, we are well-resourced with facilities such as an Art Studio & Gallery and Performing Arts Studio. Our engaging arts programme exposes students to varied art forms and experiences; they may also pursue the arts through the upper secondary Art, Drama or Enhanced Music programmes. Our students undergo a progressive PE programme that equips them with skills in sports & games and leverages on dance education to build physical conditioning and movement fundamentals. Through a vibrant Character and Citizenship Education programme that actively involves our students in serving the community, the integration of values in the curriculum & co-curriculum, the daily sharing of values and the Ethical Choices (EtCh) Programme, our students hone their socio-emotional competencies, imbibe sound values and learn to make ethical choices in life."
