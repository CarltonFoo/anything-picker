Student Leadership Development is another key programme where numerous opportunities are provided for students to exercise and develop their leadership skills. The school also has a Scholars' Development Programme to provide a suitable learning environment that caters for students with higher academic abilities. The students in the Scholars class participate in the Scholars' Development Programme to better equip them with the right skills and mindset for their all-round development. The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at all levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
