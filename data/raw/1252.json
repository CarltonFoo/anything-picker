		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Every Child Holistic Programme : Every Child Holistic Programme (ECHP) is a unique programme that enables our school to cater to the holistic development of the pupils and to develop their talents. Under the overarching ECHP, every child will be developed to be a leader, a writer, a performer, an artist and a responsible citizen.  Every Child A Performer (LLP) : Every Child A Performer (ECAP) benefits all pupils at various levels of development. Besides cultivating interest and nurturing talent in Performing Arts, the programme emphasizes on character building and citizen education to prepare our pupils for the 21st Century. Our Performing Arts modules from  P1 to P6 enable all pupils to acquire music and dance skills and develop social emotional competencies. Pupils' creativity is expressed through exposure to musical instruments and genre of dance. All pupils have the opportunity to become confident performers and active contributors on \"Rainbow Days\" when they perform on stage. Pupils who display greater interest in Performing Arts have more opportunities to develop their passion and talents through participating in Aesthetics CCAs.   Nurturing Thinkers through Knowledge Building (KB) Practices (ALP)  : KB practices have been well developed in our school through our collaboration with ETD/MOE over the years to promote Computer Supported Collaborative Learning. In KB, the teacher models the inquiry process while encouraging the pupils to build on each other's knowledge via the online Knowledge Forum  (KF), and to be engaged in collaborative learning. The ALP is designed to support the progressive development of thinking, communication and collaboration skills among pupils. Through the ALP, pupils will be introduced to thinking routines at lower primary before deepening their learning on KB principles. KB skills are applied through project work when pupils are at upper primary. The programme leverages on ICT to enrich learning and enhances the development of 21CC."
