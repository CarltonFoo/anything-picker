Our IP students will complete 4 years of secondary education in Cedar Girls before advancing to Victoria Junior College for the A-level curriculum. The VCA IP offers a seamless 6-year programme to students who enjoy independent study and exploratory work. They will have the opportunities to heighten their interest and passion through a challenging and enriched curriculum. In our mission to develop Leaders of Character, we have a comprehensive Character, Citizenship and Leadership Development Programme which inculcates the values, attributes and competencies desired of Cedarians in their journey through life.
