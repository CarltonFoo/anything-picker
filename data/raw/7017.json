Our mission is to shape the lives of Gabrielites who will serve the community as Servant Leaders, who are  Lifelong Learners and Gracious Citizens. Our philosophy of education is guided by the Montfortian Education Charter, formed by an understanding and study of the life and works of St. Louis Marie de Montfort. We design our programmes and curriculum to develop Gabrielites grounded in the values  of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility and Care. We emphasize and respect the need for personal spiritual growth and sustain it through daily reflections and actions. Our motto, Labour Omnia Vincit (Labour Conquers All), rallies Gabrielites to persevere in all endeavours with tenacity and determination. In our Gabrielite community, there is a strong culture of care amongst staff as well as students. This care is extended to the larger community, putting our values into action through service. Gabrielites have taken their responsibilities and roles with pride and dedication, striving for excellence in all their endeavours.   Our school has sustained high levels of achievement in the areas of academia, sports, aesthetics and uniformed groups. Our character and leadership programme aims to grow and nurture our students to be Servant Leaders through progressive development from self-directed to  collaborative learners and eventually serving actively and leading effectively.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Gabrielites are developed in their Cognitive, Leadership, Aesthetics, Physical, Social and Moral domains so as to grow into STAR (Special, Transformed, Active and Ready) Gabrielites, equipped and prepared for future challenges with 21st Century competencies, anchored in the core values of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility and Care. Our Community and Youth Leadership Programme nurtures Gabrielites into leaders of character and service. The 4-year programme provides learning opportunities integrating Service Learning, Student Leadership and Outdoor Education. In their junior years, Gabrielities grow as Learners and Leaders who are Self-Directed and Collaborative. In their senior years, they become Active and Effective Learners and Leaders through their self-initiated service to the community, advocating for the causes they serve. In their growth and development to become Servant Leaders, Gabrielites acquire skills, attitudes and values through experiential activities in STAR Camp, Applied Design Service Learning, Project Work Service Learning, Digital Media Arts, Elective Modules, Heritage Trial, Mission Day, iMAD Carnival and Applied Learning Programme in Flight and Aerospace."
