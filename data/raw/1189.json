		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school has identified the Visual Arts, our LLP, as a platform to deliver a well-rounded education.  Through the visual arts, students acquire not only art-making knowledge and skills but also develop 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking skills. Our LLP also caters to the social-emotional growth of students by offering an avenue for life-long enjoyment and appreciation of artistic works and performances.  The processes of ideation, conceptualization, development, refinement and appreciation of art, coupled with the richness of different art genres, also enables pupils to strengthen their understanding of national identity and foster an appreciation of their cultural heritage.   In Townsville Primary School, we believe that every child can learn to lead. The school adopts The Leader in Townsville (LiT) programme, based on Dr Stephen Convey's 7 Habits of Highly Effectively People, to develop student leadership at different levels and equip pupils with skills to be a leader, lead their school mates and contribute to their home, the school and the community.  To build the joy of learning and promote life-long learning, the school adopts the Experiential Learning Model, which allows pupils to gain knowledge beyond what is being taught through the transformation of experience. Our pupils are given opportunities to experience, apply and reflect on their learning. For example, the Mobile Learning@TVPS provides an authentic learning environment in the Science Eco Garden. Students go through an interactive trail, learning about the wonderful life of plants and animals through the use of ICT tools like iPads. They would then apply their knowledge to specific situations/experiments and reflect on their learning."
