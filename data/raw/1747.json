		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "At Woodlands Ring Primary School (WRP), we seek to be pupil-centric in our approach and strive to meet the diverse needs of our pupils.   Project Work@WRP is a Science value-driven programme. It offers a multidisciplinary, tiered and structured programme offered to all pupils from Primary 1 to Primary 6. Through this, pupils generate knowledge from their hands-on experiments, connect their learning with nature. Most importantly, they will learn and exercise school values of Integrity, Care, Respect, Resilience and Responsibilities, or ICaRe3@WRP.  WRP makes every effort to provide learning opportunities for all pupils to be future ready global citizens, aligning to our vision of \"Passionate Learners, Gracious Citizens\", The school organises overseas learning journeys to provide opportunities for pupils to better appreciate different cultures through authentic learning experiences with their counterparts from neighbouring countries.   It is WRP's belief that every child is unique and able to excel. The school embraces the educational initiatives like the Programme for Active Learning (PAL). PAL aims to provide Primary 1 and 2 pupils with broad exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities via modules of Sports, Games and Outdoor Education, Performing Arts, Drama and Visual Arts. The school extends it to include a Sport and Aesthetics (SpA) Week for all pupils. The school also has programmes such as School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR), Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) and ICAN Math to provide support for the low-readiness pupils.  WRP believes that the pursuit of excellence must be accompanied by the development of good character. Through the planned programmes like form teacher guidance period (FTGP), cyberwellness education or Character & Citizenship education in MT language, pupils learn about values. They then are given opportunities to \"practise\" these values through platforms like PAL lessons and Values-In-Action."
