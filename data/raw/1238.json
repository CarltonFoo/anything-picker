		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Keming Primary School is a school with humble beginnings and an illustrious history. Established in 1935 by public-spirited and philanthropic pioneers with an unyielding belief in education, we overcame many challenges to become today's vibrant and forward-looking school. Ours is a heart-warming story steeped in community spirit, resourcefulness and resilience.    Today, Keming continues to stand firm in our belief to work together with the community to provide a holistic education to our students to develop them to their full potential so that they will \"Grow and Glow\" to become good and useful citizens who make positive contributions to society.   Specifically, we believe in guiding and helping our students to develop their Moral, Aesthetic, Physical, Intellectual, Emotional and Social (MA PIES) domains to the full.  Keming aims to:  (1)     develop character by anchoring our students with the R3ICH values and equipping them with Social Emotional (SE) competencies,  (2)   build a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy skills as well as inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry and equipping our students with the 21st Century competencies for future education, employment and citizenship.",

An integrated platform for students to learn 21st Century competencies, our Inter-disciplinary Project Work develops our students in critical thinking and oral communication skills.  To promote active citizenry in our students to make a difference to lives of others in the community, our school-wide Student Leadership Development Programme provides platforms for students to voice their opinions and involves them in school improvement projects.  Our Overseas Learning Journeys aim to widen the horizon of our students, leading them to become future global citizens who are able to appreciate different cultures through authentic learning experiences with their counterparts from neighbouring countries.  Our Talent Development Programme identifies and provides opportunities to develop our students' areas of strength in different domains so as to maximise their potential.  Together with partners, our Values in Action Programme provides opportunities to raise our students' awareness of the environment and sustainable living by  engaging them in the 4Rs (Recycle, Reuse, Reduce and Refuse) and simple acts of taking care of their classroom, school environment and the community.  LOVE@Keming is a comprehensive school-wide Character Education Programme that develops our students' moral and performance character as well as Social Emotional competencies so that they will strive to \"always do the right thing\" and \"give of their best\".  Our Aesthetics Programme - Arts4All@Keming - aims to develop our students to appreciate the arts and be actively engaged in arts activities. This is achieved by exposing our students to different art forms and creating platforms to showcase their talents and build confidence."
