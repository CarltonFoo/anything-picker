Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects. ALP Project S.H.I.N.E. aims to bring about active student learning through the progressive development of 21st CC and skills such as critical thinking, creativity, innovation and collaborating learning. It is an interdisciplinary(Sci, EL, FCE & D&T) programme. The curriculum design involves the use of experiential and inquiry learning through the Design Thinking approach. The integration with subjects such as Science, English, FCE and Design and Technology allows students to see the relevance of what they are learning and apply them in the Design Challenge given. This curriculum is further enhanced with partnerships with tertiary institutions and enhanced elective modules to allow students to be aware of possible career opportunities. LLP Shape@BDS aims to develop students into healthy and physically educated enthusiasts for life through Sports and Outdoor Education. Students are nurtured through structured programme from Sec 1 to Sec 5. Each level takes on a thematic Sports for life programme: Sec 1 - Swimmers for Life, Sec 2 - Outdoors for Life, Sec 3 - Active Movers for Life and Sec 4/5 - Fitness Enthusiasts for Life."
