Established in 1994 as a school of Hope for our feeder boys who desired a continued ACS education in a secondary school, we have been consistently moving towards our aspiration to be a school of Excellence. As a Methodist institution, we inculcate the core values of Respect, Integrity, Commitment and Excellence in our students. We believe that our students have the potential to excel and provide opportunities for them to do so through a unique ACS(BR) education that nurtures future-ready leaders.  Our double niche areas are in our Applied Learning Programme \"Developing Effective Communicators through Drama, Debates and Public Speaking\" and Lifelong Learning Programme \"Building Character through Sports and Outdoor Education\".  We offer a holistic and broad-based education that strikes a balance between the academic and non-academic, so that we can provide an environment that is happy, enriching and fulfilling.  True to our mission, we aim to touch hearts by creating memories and giving meaning to all that we do, empower minds by sharpening the intellect and broadening perspectives, and enrich souls by growing in faith and serving others.
