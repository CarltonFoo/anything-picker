We offer a Talent Development Programme in English and Mother Tongue Languages, Science, Mathematics and Humanities to stretch our students' potential. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is in the area of Aviation and Aerospace titled S.O.A.R (Student-centered Opportunities for AeRospace Industry). The ALP aims to develop deep knowledge and skills in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Under ALP, students will develop 21st Century Skills, learn to collaborate in projects, apply critical thinking and communication skills. Students take up workshops on aero-modelling, visit aviation management industries and take elective modules related to aerospace and aviation. The school's Learning For Life Programme (LLP), Service & Leadership Through School to Nation, aims to nurture Changkateers with a heart to serve, through a 3-tiered programme designed to impart skills necessary to initiate and carry out community service projects. Our leadership development modules provide many opportunities to develop holistic student leadership competencies. Our twinning programmes with China and other overseas trips help our students prepare for a future in a globalised world, while programmes like Breakfast with Form Teacher foster strong teacher-student relationships as we guide them towards success with integrity. Finally, the school offers an After School Engagement Programme (ASE) where students can engage in self-study, consult teachers or participate in recreational activities after curriculum hours in a purpose built ASE room."
