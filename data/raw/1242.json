		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school believes in providing opportunities for all students to be part of a holistic school experience that prepares them for the future. The key school-wide programmes, as featured below, are designed to meet our student profile, needs and interests while offering to our students a buffet of opportunities for holistic development:  Start-Right Programme (SRP) The school believes in cultivating a positive culture of learning by developing the desired mindset of starting the year right. Conducted at the start of every semester, our SRP consists of modules that focus on establishing desired expectations and behaviours, enhancing Socio-Emotional competencies, equipping students with strategies to learn and honing their leadership skills.  Applied Learning Programme: Nature-Based Education (NBE)  Through three key areas of focus - Nature Exploration, Nature as Learning Context, and Applied Learning in Nature Conservation, the NBE provides our students with opportunities to construct their own meaning of knowledge and acquire life skills through interaction with the environment around them.  Learning for Life Programme: Creative-Arts Education (CAE) The CAE facilitates the acquisition of the Art knowledge and technical skills, the development of life-ready competencies such as creativity, innovation, cross-cultural understanding and resilience, and the inculcation of our school values.  Every student is given opportunities for creative action, artistic pleasure and emotional response as well as to gain insights into cultural values and beliefs.  Loyang IT (LIT) Programme  The LIT programme aims to build our students' ICT competencies, deepen their learning through ICT and cultivate a socially responsible culture through cyber wellness. During the 1-hour weekly lesson, students are provided with learning tasks to apply the ICT knowledge and skills such as presentation tools, Web 2.0 and video editing to deepen their learning in respective subject areas."
