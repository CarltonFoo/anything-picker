		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Pei Hwa, with its long history in serving the community, pride ourselves in providing our students with a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education through our distinctive-Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Robotics & Programming, which includes micro:bit technology training (Code for Fun with IMDA), Co-Space Robotics Competitions (collaboration with Singapore Polytechnic), Science and Engineering Electives and Advanced Elective Modules (with other Polytechnics) and Internship with Newcastle University International. This emphasis on developing the 21st Century Competencies can also be seen in our \"Learning For Life Programme: Community Youth Leadership\" (LLP: CYL), which commits our students to Values-In-Action (VIA) activities to develop their spirit of social innovation through learning about community issues, initiating actions to make a difference and reflecting on the values and life-skills learnt. Pei Hwa's curriculum is also anchored upon the Experiential Education (EE) Framework, which focuses on the joy of learning through engaging and effective equipping of knowledge, skills and values. For example, through the school's School-Based Curriculum Innovation (SCI), students conduct inter-disciplinary research projects in diverse Singapore's contexts such as Sengkang West Estate, Tiong Bahru's heritage sites and Army Museum. Through our Special Learning Spaces such as the Makers' Space, our students can be designers and creators of knowledge through building an innovative, inquiring and scientific mindset."
