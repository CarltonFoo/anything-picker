		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Dazhong Primary School (DZPS) has a long history of almost 80 years. Anchored on our firm belief that every child can learn and give of one's best, we strive to groom every student to serve beyond oneself and faces challenges with resilience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A student-centric approach is adopted in designing our holistic curriculum to help every student live out our school's values of 'IREAP': 'Integrity, Responsibility, Excellence, Acceptance and Perseverance'. Our six-year structured curriculum through our LLP-Arts Education programme offers a myriad of learning experiences which help to cultivate in every student, 'Howard Gardner's 5 Minds for The Future' - The Disciplinary Mind, The Synthesizing Mind, The Creating Mind, The Respectful Mind & The Ethical Mind'.  This prepares them to be self-directed learners, gracious and resilient citizens who seek to serve beyond self for the future.                                                                                                                                                                                       Coupled with a warm and caring environment afforded by a team of committed staff, we believe that our students can become 'Achievers rooted in values, soaring beyond limits'.",
