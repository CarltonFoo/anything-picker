Since Yu Neng Primary School has established itself as a school of choice, recognised for its excellence in both the academic and non-academic domains, with outstanding achievement particularly in Sports and ICT.   In tandem with Singapore's rapid development over the decades, Yu Neng too, has evolved over time. Guided by the school values GR3IT - Graciousness, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, and Teamwork, we are committed to prepare our students to be future-ready and ready to handle the challenges of the volatile and complex world.  The 6-year Yu Neng Experience aims to nurture passionate learners, creative thinkers and caring leaders where learning opportunities are accessible to all, regardless of backgrounds. By providing a student-centric values driven education, we want to inspire every student to 'think big and dream big' and to provide them with the necessary support, platforms and opportunities to excel and thrive in the 21st century.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The well-rounded 6-year curriculum is designed to provide every student the opportunity to grow the joy of learning, demonstrate thinking and creativity, and nurture leadership skills. A variety of pedagogical approaches are adopted to engage the mind, heart and hands of the students. The school's vibrant learning environment, supported by ICT, extends learning beyond the classrooms and lends a leading edge for our students in the knowledge-driven society.  Building on our strength in ICT, Yu Neng (YN) offers the Applied Learning Programme \"3E Experiences@YNPS\" which seeks to nurture every YN student to be Future-ready 21st Century Learners. The school-wide 6 year programme provides all students with the \"Exposure\" where they will gain in 6 different 'aspects', namely baseline ICT skills, coding skills, aesthetics, multimedia production and cyber wellness. Students who demonstrate aptitude and interest in ICT will have the opportunity to be part of the \"Engagement\" and \"Excellence\" experience. One of the  accolades includes the co-development of a financial literacy app, The Mighty Savers, by P4 students with OCBC to teach primary school children the importance of managing money wisely. Riding on the past decades of Sport excellence in Table tennis and Badminton, YN is moving on to provide for Learning for Life with a focus on Sports and Leadership. We believe that our students can develop a robustness of character and grit, instill a desire to strive for excellence through the provision of an inclusive sports culture. The Creative Arts programme aims to cultivate students' interest in and appreciation for the arts. Our students would have the opportunities to create art animation, ceramics and 3D printing. Beyond skills and techniques, the school also facilitated performance and exhibition opportunities at school, community and national platforms. This process enables students to build and develop soft skills that will enable them to thrive in the future."
