		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Character and Citizenship Education is the common thread that binds both the core and co-curriculum programmes in WRS.  The school's Applied Learning Programme - Robotics Education - ensures that every student is put through a Robotics-infused Design & Technology curriculum at lower secondary. Robotics Education instils in students a curiosity to learn through experimentation, questioning, problem-solving and risk-taking. It provides integration of learning across disciplines which include Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and develops in students the ability to make connections with real-life problems. As an extension of their learning and to provide our students early exposure to possible post-secondary courses of study and future work opportunities, the school will be offering an ITE-Applied Subject Mobile Robotics to our Secondary 3NT students in 2017. A Drama-in-Curriculum programme is introduced for lower secondary students to develop oracy and self-confidence through creative expression of their ideas and imagination. One special feature in the co-curriculum is Outdoor Education. Secondary 2 students attend a CCE camp during which they are given opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of the six NE messages and hone their social emotional competencies. Secondary 3 students learn more about resilience during a four-day camp by Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin. The school's Learning for Life Programme - Student Leadership Development through Involvement in the Community - aims to instil in students the purpose of caring for and leading others in the community through their involvement in community outreach activities. By working with partners, both locally and overseas, the programme is designed to help students better appreciate what they have and live out the school values of 'Responsibility, Respect & Resilience' and motto 'Serve the School and Community'."
