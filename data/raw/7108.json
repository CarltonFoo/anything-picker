The programme further provides a good foundation for those interested in pursuing a career in the media industry. The school also offers a Learning for Life Programme (Good Samaritan Programme) which focuses on community and youth leadership development. We believe our students are able to lead by example, and can lead others in both actions and thoughts. The Good Samaritan Programme is slanted towards providing service to the community in the form of Values In Action projects across levels. Students also have opportunities to work with external agencies in planning for community projects, and organising the school's Teens Conference. Students can build their strengths through other academic and co-curricular programmes: the Science Research Programme, Mathematics Olympiad, Advanced Elective Modules, Elective Modules for Normal Academic and Normal Technical students, NTerprise Programme, Religious & Moral Education, Overseas Values In Action Programme, Level Camps, Sports Carnival, Road Run, Level Games, etc."
