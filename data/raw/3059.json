		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our Highly Effective Youth programme aims to develop the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens in our students, in tandem with the Highly Effective Community Leaders programme which empowers them to render useful service to those in need.  All our students participate in the National Youth Achievement Award programme to develop self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility to themselves, society and nation.  To support this, the Social-Emotional Learning Festival provides avenues (e.g. creative arts, dragon boating, kayaking, rock-climbing, abseiling, trekking, camps and overseas adventure and community service) for students to further hone their interpersonal skills and our Learn to Play Sports programme encourages participation in physical recreation. Our Design and Engineering programme enables students to integrate scientific innovations with human desirability and economic viability and the STAR programme challenges students to stretch themselves in their areas of strengths (e.g. Maths Olympiad, Innovation Programme, Art Elective, Debates, and Humanities and Sciences explorations).  The T3 programme builds teacher-student relationships through weekly discussions and sharing over tea."
