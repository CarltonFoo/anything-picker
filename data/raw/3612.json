		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Aerospace opens a pathway for our students to make a career choice in the rapidly growing aerospace industry by giving them an edge when applying for aerospace-related courses in ITE and the Polytechnics. All Lower Secondary students are equipped with basic knowledge in general aerospace topics and requisite ICT skills. Students found to be passionate in this area would be sent to participate in external related competitions and programmes. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Outdoor Education (Adventure, Character, Environment) aims to inculcate values, develop character and build leadership skills of all students through a three-tiered programme using nature and the outdoors. Through programmes such as orienteering, rockwall climbing and Values-In-Action (VIA) activities, we hope to cultivate in students a love for the outdoors and a heart for the environment they live in. Annual camps that emphasise experiential learning, values education and self-leadership are held concurrently for each level. A variety of enrichment programmes are also provided by the school to widen the exposure of students in the cognitive, physical and aesthetics domains. For example, the Stained Glass Art Programme is used as a tool to express creativity and to develop the spirit of Innovation and Enterprise. As the making of stained glass artwork requires intricate skill and patience, students working in teams develop fortitude, resilience and learn to value each other's strengths. The Whole School Approach to Effective Communication (WSA-EC) aims to build students' competencies in communicating in English and incorporates learning activities in various subject disciplines, all designed to raise students' interest and motivation in reading and speaking good English."
