		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Holistic English Literacy Program (HELP)  We envision every student to be an educated child and a contributing citizen, ready to serve and lead. In line with this vision, the English department has anchored a distinctive program, Holistic English Literacy Program (HELP) with the intent of imparting language skills to our students so that they feel empowered to use these skills in their community service learning projects.   To enable learners to emerge as effective leaders in their own right, we strive on fostering a learning environment that extends far beyond the classroom walls. This \"service learning\" acts as a catalyst in enhancing both, student growth and the common good. Most importantly, it recognises the need to engage pupils in a natural learning process that is real and purpose driven. The underpinning belief in the development of this program is that children will be motivated to learn if they are presented with a strong purpose to do so.  Purposefully crafted activities intend to help young people acquire the skills, attitudes, and beliefs that fully engage them in community life and help them move from the periphery of their community to its center.  We believe that an emphasis on the public good challenges young minds to identify needs and strengths,  both in themselves and their community and to find creative ways for improving community conditions. HELP serves as an avenue to fulfil our school's vision of being a place where all students engage in learning, achieve to the best of their ability, and become productive citizens and participants of the community."
