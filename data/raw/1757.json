		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school believes in the importance of developing effective communication skills in the students as part of holistic education. The Mastery In Communication Skills (MICS) Programme developed by the EL Department leverages the use of speech and drama activities to systematically develop in all Compassvalites the confidence and oral competency to navigate in the 21st century.  The school's ALP on 'Developing 21CC Through Robotics in Math & Science Curriculum' leverages the use of robotics to enhance teaching and learning of Math & Science while developing 21CC in students. Students acquire social and emotional skills as they engage actively in self-directed and collaborative learning activities that require them to overcome challenges and seek solutions to novel situations. This makes learning of Math and Science an enjoyable experience for them as well as strengthens the link between theories and real-life applications.  The school's LLP on \"Developing Aesthetics Appreciation Through Music Empowerment\" aims to equip students with music appreciation skills and to nurture them to become active participants and informed audiences for the arts. The broad-based integrated Music programme makes the learning of aesthetics an enjoyable experience for the students. Students develop the ability for creative self-expression through the use of their voices or by playing a range of melodic and rhythmic instruments such as keyboard, percussion and string.  As part of the school's commitment to enhance our students' social and emotional learning (SEL), a resource package for parents-ESEL@Home has been developed by the CCE Department. This package aims to better equip parents with the knowledge and skills to enhance SEL in their children within the home context.  As parents are our closest partners in developing the students, the ESEL@Home offers a meaningful opportunity for the school to work in partnership with them to raise students as Soaring Individuals, Serving Citizens."
