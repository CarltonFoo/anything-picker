		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Established in 1941, Canossa Convent Primary School (CCPS) is one of the educational institutions set up by the sisters of the Canossian Daughters of Charity in Singapore. It is affiliated to St Anthony's Canossian Secondary, an autonomous school.   Canossa Convent Primary School (CCPS) is an all-girls catholic school that delivers Canossian Education which anchors in the formation of the whole person. The Canossian education emulates the work and spirit of our foundress St Magdalene of Canossa to serve the poorest of the poor. It is inclusive and embraces persons of all faiths and races and those with special needs. The Canossian education emphasizes on the formation of the heart to anchor our pupils in values especially to instil in our pupils the spirit of serving the poor.  In line with the Canossian Education of building a whole person, CCPS aims to develop our pupils to be passionate learners who are self-directed and resilient and compassionate leaders who serve with humility. CCPS graduands will be leaders of character who live the Canossian Identity which encompasses the school values of 3Cs (Commitment, Compassion and Cheerfulness).   It takes a village to raise a child and CCPS has a unique advantage as it is situated in the Canossian Eduplex, a unique borderless community, consisting of Canossa Convent, Canossa Convent Primary, Canossaville Children's Home, Canossian School for the hearing impaired, Magdalene's Kindergarten to provide for the social and educational needs of the community in Aljunied. The various sectors in the Canossian Eduplex share a common belief in the care of the child and work closely with one another to provide the love, care and education needed for the holistic development of the child.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "(1) Satellite Programme With Canossian School (CS) The hearing impaired students of CS joined CCPS for all lessons except Mother Tongue. This seamless integration of students from both schools has provided CS pupils the opportunity to be immersed in a hearing environment and CCPS pupils an environment where they begin to increase their awareness and sensitivity to students with special needs and develop empathy. It supports language development for both groups of students as they learn how to better communicate and interact with their peers from a diverse environment.   (2) Learning for Life Programme (LLP):  Service Innovation through Design Thinking With formation of the heart and service as a hallmark of Canossian schools, the school's life-long learning programme aims to provide our students the platform to acquire and apply skills that will develop them to become compassionate leaders through the design thinking process with emphasis on inculcating empathy in our students. Using a spiral approach, Design Thinking skills are explicitly taught in a progressive manner across the levels and age-appropriate authentic platforms such as the Values in Action (VIA) projects. Pupils learn to communicate effectively and handle conflicts (if any), develop empathy and perspective of others' feelings by listening to one another and seeking to understand the needs of others. Structures in the design thinking process, such as 'Creating a Persona', 'Journey Mapping' and interview, help pupils develop a deeper sense of empathy for others. Coupled with the experience of prototyping their ideas, pupils learn that they have the power to make a difference and help others beyond just feeling sympathy for others. The whole programme is designed to equip the pupils with the skills and the attitude to take action and take charge to solve problems around them. We would like them to be concerned citizens and an active contributor to the society."
