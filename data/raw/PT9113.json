	"Centre Details": "Our philosophy: -\nEducation is an aid to life??, Dr Maria Montessori\nThe best time to start your child??s education is during early years when most of your child??s intelligence and social characteristics are formed. During this time, a child??s mind is extremely absorbent and his curiosity is at a peak. When properly nourished and stimulated, the child develops habits and skills that will serve him well for a lifelong learning. \n\nICHIBAN MONTESSORI aims to provide such quality childcare education that emphasizes the potential of young children and at the same time helping them to develop a love for learning.",
