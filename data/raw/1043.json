		"School Vision": "A future-ready community of passionate learners  anchored in values and striving for excellence to make a positive difference.",
		"School Mission": "Inspiring and empowering our learners to be their best for self and others through a supportive environment and innovative & effective teaching-learning practices.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "At Teck Whye Primary, we believe that all children can learn and want to learn and that teaching needs to cater to different progress levels and be anchored on meaningful engagement. Every child can be inspired and empowered to achieve within a supportive environment anchored on safety and care. Teachers, as role models, impart sound values, build character and inspire their students to learn by building quality relationships with and among students. To meet future challenges, our students must extend their learning beyond the acquisition of knowledge and skills, and apply and use their learning in meaningful ways.  Established since 1959, Teck Whye Primary envisions our learners to achieve the following outcomes and exercise the related values in their daily lives:   Confident Communicators who Engage with Respect   Healthy Individuals who eXercise Responsibility   Adaptive Leaders who Collaborate with Integrity   Model Citizens who Encourage through Compassion   Passionate Learners who Learn with Resilience The rallying call is for CHAMPs who embrace and strive for the value of Excellence.  To realise these outcomes, the school provides a strong grounding in the various subjects while placing emphasis on the (i) acquisition of 21st century competencies, (ii) development of effective communication skills and an understanding of media use and production, (iii) inculcation of values and social emotional development, (iv) understanding of the importance of National Education and (v) development of leadership competencies.  The school, therefore, whilst encouraging our students to do well academically, also places a very strong emphasis on character and holistic development. We believe that this would provide a firm foundation for our students as they pursue their secondary education but more importantly as they live their lives.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Teck Whye Primary's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is entitled 'Media Whiz Kids!', a media and media literacy-based programme. The programme aims to enable our students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired in Languages, Technology, Art and Music to authentic and meaningful contexts.  Specialised media programmes will support those with talents and a keen interest through our various CCAs such as the Infocomm Club, iDesign Club, and Speech and Drama Club. The ALP is intended to develop confident students who can put across their thoughts and ideas verbally and in written form in both digital and non-digital platforms, and are able to harness relevant tools and media to enhance communication. Programming to promote computational thinking will also be introduced to students as part of this ALP.  Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), entitled 'I Lead, I Serve', is a leadership development programme which adapts Kouzes and Posner's five practices of exemplary leadership to guide the development of leadership competencies. Stories will be used as a primary means to raise awareness of leadership skills and dilemmas. The programme is centred on a core belief that leadership is about service to others and students will be involved in a range of learning experiences which will vary in complexity depending on their ages and leadership roles.  The school's CHAMP programme emphasises the development of character and students will have the opportunity to reflect and act on the school values. Parents are also encouraged to be involved as part of this programme.  Our students also undergo a variety of other special programmes as part of the school curriculum. These include structured Arts development from P1-6 where they will learn about musical instruments such as the Ukulele and digital keyboards, and art forms such as Manga, Chinese Painting and Batik Painting. Sports programmes such as Tennis, Archery and Bowling are also provided to broaden our students' experiences."
