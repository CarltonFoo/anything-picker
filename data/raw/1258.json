		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Westwood Primary was founded in 2013, premised on the core philosophy of Positive Education.  Our overarching goal is for our staff and pupils to strive for both excellence and wellbeing, and for our school community to thrive and flourish.  Learning is delivered with positive engagement so as to invite every pupil on a journey of discovery and holistic development.  Discipline is promoted in a respectful way to engender self-reflection and growth.  By emphasising positive motivation and affirmative attitudes, we nurture an awareness of greatness and potential in each and every staff and pupil, as they set personalised goals and ultimately demonstrate creative expression, problem-solving, and meaningful achievement.    In keeping with the philosophy of Positive Education, Westwood Primary's Staff Belief is that Every One is a Talented and Unique Individual with Potential for Success. Our Westwood School Culture is one of care, love and drive, and we aspire in going the extra mile in everything we do.  To enable all staff and pupils to believe that he or she can be an agent of change, with opportunities to use his or her talents and skills to benefit others, our positive school culture is grounded in our core values of A Heart of Gratitude, A Resilient Mindset, A Passion for Community and A Future-Ready Confidence.  A THRIVE Framework for Positive Education has been developed to ensure that school policies, practices and programmes are aligned to the six key domains of positive accomplishment (Thinking mindfully); positive health (Healthy coping); positive relationship (Relating well); positive engagement (In the moment); positive meaning (Values-driven actions); and positive emotions (Emotions of positivity).  To this end, we actively partner parents and the wider community, seeking opportunities to contribute to community life, while living out the message of positivity, hope and well-being.",

Accordingly, our signature school programmes are as follows:   Applied Learning Programme (Positive Design & Innovation):  With inter-disciplinary project work as a platform, pupils learn about the principles of positive design and thinking protocols, and explore how their ideas and observations can be turned into useful designs and solutions that benefit their peers and their community.   Learning for Life Programme (Student Leadership & Community Service): Throughout their time in Westwood Primary, every child is given an opportunity for leadership, and comprehensive training and mentoring is provided to support each child is their leadership journey. Westwoodians are also given many opportunities to give back to their community via class-wide and level-wide programmes.   Holistic Learning, Assessment and Reporting: Westwood Primary has adopted a whole-school approach towards holistic assessment, aligning PERI-HA practices with its founding philosophy of Positive Education. Formative Assessment (FA) practices are adopted in all classrooms, so as to promote learner engagement and ensure every child has a voice. Positive questioning and process praise help children to focus on the process of learning.  Westwood Primary also engages parents in Holistic Assessment, via the annual Teacher-Parent-Pupil Conference, where pupils share what and how they have learnt with their parents, prompting authentic discussions that involve each child in personalised learning.   Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for Lower Primary Pupils:  Our PAL Framework is guided by VIP principles, with the programme being Values-Driven, Incorporating Innovative Learning and being Positive-Education-focused."
