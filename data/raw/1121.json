		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Character Education - We seek to imbue strong values in our students & develop in them a deep sense of belonging & rootedness to Singapore. Students learn about empathy & care for the environment & fellow citizens through our VIA projects.  Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - Science for Life@HPPS allows students to apply scientific content knowledge & process skills to real-life situations through inquiry-based learning.   Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Sports4Life@HPPS aims to build character & instil values through Sports and Outdoor Education. A key feature of our LLP is the Sports Leaders Development Programme, which focuses on developing students in the physical and leadership domains. A modular Gymnastics Programme for P1 & 2 students develop students' motor skills, and build flexibility, agility and strength which are fundamental to the development of advanced motor skills.   Programme for Active Learning (PAL) - Lower Primary students are exposed to varied & fun learning experiences in four domains: Sports & Games, Outdoor Education, Performing & Visual Arts to nurture a child's socio-emotional competencies, curiosity, co-operative skills & confidence.   Literature Programme - Through the exposure to different genres, students are taught to appreciate and analyse good language use. As they examine texts through close character study, they are taught to be sensitive and empathetic towards others.  Innovation Programme (IvP) - IvP provides a unique opportunity for students to develop their problem-solving & inventive skills through IvP lessons, draft sessions with expert mentors & a 1-day Seminar. The programme culminates in the Young Innovators' Fair.   Exchange Programme with The Japanese School in Singapore - This partnership, which began in 1990, includes student & teacher exchanges, as well as a Homestay Programme for P5 students. Through the various activities, students & teachers gain a deeper understanding & appreciation of each other's culture."
