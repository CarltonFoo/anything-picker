		"School Vision": "To nurture pupils so that they can excel in their pursuits and contribute to the society, through providing a holistic education and a dynamic learning environment.",
		"School Mission": "Passionate Learners,Caring Leaders, Global Citizens",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Tanjong Katong Primary started in 2001 as an amalgamation of 3 schools, Fowlie Primary(a result of an earlier merger between Fowlie and Seraya Schools), Haig Boys' and Mountbatten Primary Schools. In its earlier years, Tanjong Katong Primary was well-known for its higher proportion of international students. Even up till today, the school continues to boast of a student population that comes from diverse backgrounds in terms of their nationality and ethnicity. Since TKP opened its doors, it has made a name for itself with the all-round, balanced education it provides as well as the caring culture within the TKP community.  In TKP, we believe that every child is different and each comes with his/her unique talents and needs. As such, we are committed to nurturing each of them to fulfil his/her potential. We hope that through providing a holistic education that develop our students in the various domains, they will have opportunities to discover their strengths. We also hope that they would also be exposed to ways in which they can use what they have learnt to benefit others.  Our new vision, 'Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders, Global Citizens', is an expression of aspiration for our students so that they will be prepared and equipped for the VUCA world and the future ahead.  We strive to provide a dynamic learning environment so that our students may develop a love of learning, not just learning during their schooling years but into their life, long after they have left school. We nurture them so that they could excel in their pursuits. When they succeed in life, we hope that they would have empathy and care about others; and contribute back to the society. We would also like to continue to tap on the unique profile of the students to cultivate the cross-cultural skills essential for them to thrive in a globalised world.  To this cause, we will work with our partners, including parents, alumni and the community, to enrich the learning experiences of our students.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "3i Approach  TKP has designed a balanced curriculum that nurtures different interests, abilities and talents based on the 3i approach, namely instruction, interaction and inquiry. Therefore, our teachers are committed to: 1) design and customise curriculum content and its accompanying pedagogical approaches and strategies in explicit instruction, 2) use strategies (e.g. STELLAR, PERI-HA, MTV) and leverage on programmes (e.g. Learning Carnivals, Learning Journeys and MTL Fortnight) to establish a tone of learning environment for positive  interaction, and 3) to develop higher-order thinking through inquiry-based teaching and learning in various subjects, Project Work, and ICT integration in all academic subjects to achieve active inquiry.  Lifelong Learning Programme: Team Sports Excellence@TKP As part of our school's strong tradition in sports and our belief in values inculcation and learning of socio-emotional competencies, our school has developed Team Sports Excellence@TKP programme. A two-pronged approach is used for this programme: 1) the Active Lifestyle Programme targeted at all pupils, and 2) the Sports Pursuit Programme for talent development. Four team sports (football, netball, hockey and floorball) have been identified to further develop talent and interest in our students, and to provide opportunities for their pursuit of excellence.   Heritage Programmes In order to instil a sense of belonging and rootedness to the school and the community we live in, heritage programmes which tapped on the history of the school as well as the rich heritage and culture of Katong have been developed. The TKP Heritage Gallery has been set up to educate our students on the history of Katong and the school. Interactive trails around Katong using mobile devices designed by our students were also developed. Since their inception, our students have gone on these i-trails as part of the Social Studies curriculum."
