		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our Journalists in Making, an Applied Learning Programme, aims to develop our students in critical thinking, oral and written communication skills and build their confidence to speak and write on any chosen topic at the class, school or community level. Presentations during recess and at school events are platforms to build students' confidence. Students who would like to learn more about journalism can participate in the Journalists' Club where they learn more about being a journalist through workshops and platforms like reporting real-time news during school events.  Through our Learning for Life Programme, Aesthetics Alive, students learn to draw, play instruments, compose songs and appreciate music and art through our structured Art and Music Curricula. Students are also provided the opportunities to experiment with different musical instruments and dances during recesses. Students who have a flair for dancing and music can also participate in our Performing Arts CCAs such as  Modern Jazz Dance and Angklung Ensemble where more specific skills are taught and students also develop team spirit and leadership qualities.   To help students make informed choices, P4 to P6 students make use of the ECG portal to find out more about themselves and the type of secondary schools that would be suitable for them. P6 students attend a one-day immersion programme at selected secondary schools to provide students with the opportunity to experience secondary school life and better understand about the secondary school curriculum. Career talks and talks by former students are some platforms where our students could find out more about secondary school life and the careers that they are interested in."
