		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "1) Applied Learning Programme (ALP): The school leverages on the new media through ALP in Sonic Arts, 'Music, Media & Technology' to provide students with a strong foundation and exposure to established and emerging disciplines such as Music Technology and Recording Arts (Music & Media).  2) Learning for Life Programme (LLP): The school's LLP on Community Youth Leadership (CYL) focuses on providing students with opportunities to lead in serving the community. The programme forms an extension to Values-In-Action (VIA) experiences and provides opportunities for Yishunites to broaden their understanding of the needs and aspirations of the community through authentic experiences and deepen the development of leadership skills and attitudes. 3) Curricular Innovations: Each department embarks on curricular innovations to develop students' passion for learning through school programmes such as Sports and ArTz Carnival. Pedagogical approaches such as the use of a constructivist approach to learning geometry, interdisciplinary approaches in English Drama, Project Work, Elective Modules (EMs) and Advanced EMs, and learning based on \"Enduring Understandings\", form an integral part of the school's authentic learning experience.  4) Character and Citizenship Education Programme: Key programmes that build students' character include Enterprise Day, Citizenship Education Learning Journeys, Sec 2 Adventure Camp and Sec 3 Internationalisation Trips. The school leverages on its strong partnerships with various community groups for our student leadership and citizenship education programmes to develop \"caring hearts\" in all Yishunites. The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
