		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "CTSS places a strong emphasis on providing a holistic education to every student. We focus on inculcating values, skills and dispositions in our students that will place them in good stead to thrive with passion and purpose in the future. Our key student development programmes are as follows:  With our strong foundation in Uniformed Groups (UGs), CTSS seeks to achieve the vision 'Every Cadet, A Leader' through our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), which develops leadership qualities in Clementeens through a structured UG experience and yearly cohort camps. Other character development programmes include the 7 Habits for Highly Effective Youths (featured in Stephen Covey's book 'The Leader in Me'), the Normal Technical REAL (Reflective, Experiential, Authentic, Leadership) Curriculum, and a structured and well-planned Service Learning programme for all students.  The school's Teaching and Learning framework emphasises Rigour, Relevance and Relationship. A segmentised approach is taken to deliver the core curriculum to all, give support to weaker students, and develop those with unique talents. Special programmes include Drama-in-Curriculum, Science Talent Development Programme and Project Work.  The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), C.O.D.E. (Computing to Discover and Empower), helps our students thrive in the digital age by equipping them with computational thinking and programming skills. The school also offers O-level Computing as an applied subject."
