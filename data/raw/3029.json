		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "CTSS places a strong emphasis on character education and firmly believes in providing a holistic education to every student. With our strong foundation in Uniformed Groups (UGs), CTSS seeks to achieve the vision 'Every Cadet, A Leader' through our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), which develops leadership qualities in Clementeens through a structured UG experience. Acclaimed character development programmes such as 7 Habits for Highly Effective Youths (featured in Stephen Covey's book 'The Leader in Me'), Normal Technical REAL (Reflective, Experiential, Authentic and Leadership) Curriculum, Student Leadership and National Education Programmes and Service-Learning nurture 21st Century Competencies and resilience in our students. The school's Teaching and Learning framework guides teachers in the design, delivery and development of our teaching practices which would shape our students' learning experiences. The emphasis on Rigour, Relevance and Relationship guide a segmentised approach to deliver the core curriculum to all, give support to weaker students, and develop those with unique talents. Special programmes, such as Drama-in-Curriculum, Science and Maths Talent Development Programes and LOTM (Learning on the Move) using technology, are put in place to foster authentic experiential learning.  The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), C.O.D.E. (Computing to Discover and Empower), helps our students thrive in the digital age by equipping them with computational thinking and programming skills.  The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
