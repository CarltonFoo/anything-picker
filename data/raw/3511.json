		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Leveraging on our strong partnerships with the polytechnics and our tradition of providing an engineering-based education, we provide our students the opportunity to pursue applied subjects such as Electronics, as well as Elective and Advanced Elective Modules. Students of different abilities also have the opportunity to offer subjects such as Additional Mathematics and Literature (English), on top of the Pure Sciences. Through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Tanglin P.L.U.S (Perspectives and Literacies to Understand Society), we aim to establish a distinctive programme in the Humanities. Tanglin P.L.U.S aims to complement the school's existing strengths in Mathematics, Science and Applied Subjects by equipping students with a deeper understanding of national and global issues that will ensure our students receive a well-rounded education which equally values skills of empathy, perspective-taking, diplomacy and public relations. For Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP), TSS leverages on its strengths in the Aesthetics to enable it to launch an enhanced Arts education programme for its students, S4 Through the Arts @ TSS Programme. S4 Through the Arts @ TSS Programme offers our students a 3-year programme that introduces the four arts forms (Music, Art, Drama and Dance) through General Music Programme (GMP), General Art Programme (GAP), Print-to-Screen-to-Stage Programme and a structured Aesthetics Education Programme (AEP) that includes dance and the learning of a musical instrument. For those with passion and interest in the arts, they can also join the Performing Arts Co-Curricular Activities, or opt for Elective Module (EM) and Advanced Elective Module (AEM) in the performing arts. Our customised four-year Student Leadership Development Programme ensures that our students are equipped with the leadership skills and competencies so that they become compassionate leaders who are ready to serve society."
