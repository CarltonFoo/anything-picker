		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "The Lasallian Philosophy is to form a community where teachers and students can live their faith and become the persons that God wants them to be.  We believe that: - The love of Christ binds together as children of God, people of all races and conditions, rich or poor, bright or otherwise, for all are made in God's image and members of His family. On this faith rests the mutual love and respect that is fostered between teacher and student.  - The Brothers and their lay colleagues educate the young in the tradition of our founder, St John Baptist de La Salle, giving attention to all and especially to students whose development is hindered by economic, personal and other problems. - Religious development is not isolated from development of the mind and conscience, nor from development of the body.  Logic and analysis, honesty and team-work in games, all provide a sound foundation for understanding religion and living by one's beliefs. - We teach what is true, just, good and beautiful, guided by our Catholic philosophy which finds harmony not contradiction, in spirit and matter, in faith and reason. - Like parents, teachers labour to form the minds and characters of students and become transformed in the process, as teacher and student help each other grow as persons.  Students must learn how to learn as they need to teach themselves after leaving school. - Success in school means more than good examination results.  It means learning how to live as well as how to make a living.  Our mission is fulfilled when our students: - Understand and accept themselves and others, develop their talents in service to society, to nation and to the world. - Think logically and critically and express themselves effectively.   - Know clearly what they believe and why they believe.   - Believe and trust in God, maintain physical fitness and mental health, avoiding excesses and abuses, possess social awareness and a sense of responsibility for the common good.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our school has two Learning for Life Programmes (LLP): 1. The \"Physical EducAtion and Sports for every StephenIAN\" (PASSIAN) LLP aims to develop all Stephenians to demonstrate physical and sports skills, sportsmanship, teamwork and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living and reinforcing the school's mission of \"learning how to learn and learning how to live.\"   PASSIAN adopts the AST (Awareness, Skills, Talent) approach for pupil development. This 3-tier approach will enable Stephenians -   to be given exposure to PE and Sports activities (Awareness level)  -   to develop skills in PE and Sports (Skills level) -   who have high abilities in PE and Sports to be identified and developed (Talent level)  2. The \"MUsic for STephenians\" (MUST) LLP uses music and its performance to leverage on implicit opportunities to imbue our pupils with an appreciation that success comes with hard work and diligence, reinforcing our mission of learning how to learn and learning how to live. The MUST programme provides a platform for every Stephenian to develop his musical sense and talent and supports the school's mission.  The MUST programme extends from the AST framework of the school's Arts education policy, outlining the school's commitment to the arts and the importance of the arts in the creative educational development of young people. This approach allows Stephenians to be provided with: -   exposure to a range of artwork and music genres and disciplines to stimulate an interest in the arts.  (Awareness level) -   opportunities to learn a range of different and unique skills in art and music as well as providing universal skills and creative learning experiences across all learning areas. (Skills level) -   opportunities for pupils who have talent to excel in the specific area of the arts. (Talent level)"
