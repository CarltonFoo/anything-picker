It comprises exposure to and experiences in the performing arts, music, as well as digital and visual arts. Through the breadth and depth of experience, students develop their strength of character, self-discipline, self-confidence, teamwork and leadership competencies. Students' learning culminate in a biennial performances-cum-exhibition of art work, a school-based platform in collaboration with the community. The annual Student Conference is a platform for our students to share their knowledge and skills in topics of their passion. Teacher Mentors coach students, resulting in confident speakers and quality learning for all. Under the 1:1 Computing Programme, each student, equipped with a Chromebook, is developed as a self-directed and collaborative learner through progressive teaching pedagogies and cyberwellness programme."
