It delivers holistic music education through drama, speech, movements, creation and improvisation. Students are presented with learning opportunities in the realm of performing arts education through a tiered approach tied in with the school's E3 Principle - Experience/Entice (Tier 1), Enrich and Excel (Tier 2).    21st century skills and values such as kindness, respect, self-discipline and perseverance are also embedded into the programme. Responsibility towards learning their parts in contributing to ensemble playing will ensure that students evolve into self-directed and confident learners. In addition, collaborative and communicative skills during music making activities will help students learn to be effective team players. The exposure to various genres and music cultures will enable students to acquire global awareness and develop cross-cultural skills. Critical and inventive thinking skills are also  emphasised during the process of music making  and the appreciation of music and the performing arts.  Collaborative learning is emphasised via the Digital Music curriculum which allows the students to experiment and discover for themselves the layering of music, triggering virtual instrument algorithms via iPad Apps and performing as an iPad band.  Hence, through the MBS programme, the students develop a  deepened sensitivity and broadened outlook in life."
