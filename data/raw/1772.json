To achieve our school's vision of \"A Leader, A Keen Learner and A Friend\", our teachers inculcate in our pupils the belief that \"Every Clementian Can Learn\".  Clementians are encouraged to build each other up, help others grow and acknowledge each other's accomplishments.  CTP believes in supporting all the pupils' learning regardless of their ethnic, socioeconomic, and linguistic differences and backgrounds.  To nurture forward-looking pupils of exemplary character, we set high expectations for both the academic and non-academic subjects that are taught during curriculum time.  We believe in providing a balanced co-curriculum involving sports, arts and citizenship and emphasise pupils' willingness to be considerate and make personal sacrifices by putting others before self.  CTP believes in communicating with the parents and community regularly, involving them in the school programmes and collaborating with them to extend the efforts of the school.  Parents and teachers engage in regular conversations and work together to enable parents to provide strong emotional support for their children's learning at home.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "To complement the pupils' academic learning and acquisition of the 21st century competencies in alignment to the school's vision, mission and values, Clementi Primary School (CTP) has the following signature programmes:  Instilling Lifelong Learning through Visual Arts CTP aims to provide a vibrant aesthetics culture through its Learning for Life Programme (LLP) for Visual Arts and Design to nurture every Clementian to be life-long learners.  The programme provides them with collaborative opportunities to imagine, design, invent and communicate with different art media and materials and helps them to develop the skills and techniques necessary for the expression of ideas, feelings and experiences in visual and tactile forms.  It also develops their sensitivity to the aesthetic elements in their environment and fosters greater appreciation of visual arts in different forms and cultures.  CCE@CTP CCE@CTP integrates the school's Assembly Programmes, Form Teacher Guidance Period, Very Important Pupil (VIP) programme, Habits of Mind lessons, Character and Citizenship Education lessons and Values-In-Action projects to develop the pupils' character and leadership qualities and instil a strong sense of belonging to the school and nation. The programme also encourages pro-social behaviour through the strengthening of social-emotional learning competencies.  CCE@CTP has helped the school build a strong culture of care to nurture positive teacher-student relationships (TSR) and peer relationships among pupils.    By taking on this student-centric approach, pupils feel more cared for and respected when teachers show concern for them as individuals, beyond academic outcomes. Pupils consistently reported having a better quality school experience over the years with positive TSR in the school."
