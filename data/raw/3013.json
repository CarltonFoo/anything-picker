We are committed to nurturing leaders in the academic, character and arts domains. In doing so, we believe in students learning the value of stewardship,where the best and the brightest TKGians must lead through 'noble service' and to 'serve with honour', as inspired by the school song penned by the first principal Ms Maude Scott in 1953. Our aspiration for being a school of distinction must start from within, with the girls who come through our portals understand how special it is to be TKGian, to understand the obligations and responsibilities in upholding that tradition of excellence which we have built over more than 60 years.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The TKGS Curriculum aims to develop 3 distinct characteristics:(a)Leaders of Character, who lead from within in service of others: The TKGS leadership philosophy is founded on the belief that leadership is not about rank, position or title, but service in and through leadership of others. Character & Citizenship Education is implemented through our LEGACY curriculum, CCA and VIA programs, enabling girls to use the Community Problem Solving method to tackle community issues. The TKGS Truly! Programme instils TKGian identity and school pride, while the OBS Experience, Global Perspectives and Work Attachment Programmes complement our integrated approach to CCE. (b)High Achievers who are self-directed learners, demonstrating deep disciplinary understanding: Learning in the academic curriculum is anchored in a robust and progressive approach. TKGS+ is Programme for Leadership, Understanding and Stewardship, challenging TKGians to confront and tackle deeper concepts in authentic experiences beyond the classroom. There are 3 strands to TKGS+: Mathematics & Science, Languages & Humanities, and Music. TKGians offer Core and Elective Modules where they focus their learning on 21st century competencies, made possible through study trips and mentorship by professionals. TKGS is also the East Zone Centre of Excellence for English Language. (c)Women of Grace who are critical and inventive thinkers in their appreciation and pursuit of the arts: We tap into Lincoln Center's Capacities for Imaginative Learning and Visible Thinking for the study of Art, Music and Drama, leading to the O Level Examinations. In the tradition of excellence, all performing arts CCAs achieved Certificates of Distinction in the SYF 2013, 2015 and 2017."
