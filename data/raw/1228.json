These efforts have been affirmed by the Ministry of Education which awarded us with the Outstanding Development Award (Character Development) and designated our school as the West Zone Centre of Excellence for Character Development (WZ COE for CD).   As the WZ COE for CD, PEPS serves as an anchor school in the West Zone to leverage on and develop their niche, culture and excellence in CD. This includes the development of teachers through sharing best practices in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) workshops, customised programmes and sharing of CCE resources for teaching of core values and Social and Emotional (SE) competencies. These authentic resources are created by our own teachers and students. We also provide platform to nurture student leaders in primary schools in West Zone through workshop or camp to support the development of student leadership.   Learning for Life Programme (LLP) ASPIRE to Serve and Lead In alignment with our school vision , 'Every Child, an Engaged Learner, a Caring Citizen and a Steadfast Leader, the focus of our LLP would be on imbuing our students with our school's core values of Ambition, Self-discipline, Perseverance, Integrity, Respect and Empathy (ASPIRE). This is achieved through community service and tiered student leadership development via our Values In Action (VIA) programme. The ultimate aim is to lay a solid foundation for our students to appreciate the value of citizen leadership in caring for others within the community."
