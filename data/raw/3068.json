		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "In our school, we place a premium on the holistic development of students. This is anchored in our strong belief that both academic excellence and character development are pillars of a holistic education. The school's strong academic and CCA achievements, particularly in the Uniformed Groups, Sports as well as Performing Arts, are testimony to the school's commitment to enable each student to reach his/her full potential. The Jurong West (JW) Experience, grounded in Student-Centricity, is premised in our belief that when students have an interest and find enjoyment in what they do, they will do well and find greater motivation to pursue those interests beyond secondary school. As a future-oriented and forward looking school, our distinctive LLP and ALP are designed with the future and national initiatives such as smart nation in mind. The school offers a wide range of exciting opportunities in both the academic and co-curricular areas through programmes such as Student Work Attachment, Student Leadership, Overseas Student Exchange and Talent Development in English, Mathematics, Science, Art and Sports. The school also offers the Enhanced Art Programme and subjects such as Exercise and Sports Science as well as Computing. The JW experience aims to nurture passionate learners, innovative thinkers and caring leaders whilst equipping students with desired knowledge, skills, values and mind-sets to experience success not just in the present but also in the future.",
