The school aims to provide a holistic education through learner-centred approaches. As pupils have varied learning abilities and potential, our teachers are empowered to innovate and adopt creative strategies that best meet their needs.  We are guided by our philosophy, 'Every child has intrinsic worth and he can learn and wants to learn. Every child has the ability to realise his fullest potential and can contribute to society in his individual capacity'.    We believe in developing talents by helping our pupils acquire new knowledge and skills to meet future challenges. Our pupils are provided with the opportunities to discover and develop their talents across domains in a nurturing environment. This belief is reflected in our school tagline: Creating Possibilities in Students.   In line with our philosophy, character building is the core of our mission and sets the foundation for programme development. The school core values are anchored on the acronym - RICHER, which stands for Respect, Integrity, Compassion, Humility, Endurance and Responsibility. We are committed to guide pupils using Integrity as our moral compass, Endurance as the key to success, Responsibility and Humility as reflected in our actions and Respect and Compassion for better relationships.   The school has a strong culture of care and strives to be 'One CPS Family', working towards a common goal. Through the school programmes, our pupils build authentic experiences and together with the close partnership of our parents, we aim to achieve our vision of 'Nurturing Pupils who C.A.R.E to Succeed'.",

Through these programmes, pupils' talents and passion are discovered and they are offered opportunities to deepen their skills through the various CCAs.    Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Developing Pupils in the Niche Area of Dance The LLP programme in dance aims to build confidence in pupils by exposing them to different dance forms and allowing them to express their creativity through dance and music.
