		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "At Da Qiao Primary School, we believe that everyone can flourish, develop their talents/skills and become contributing citizens. Our focus on the holistic development of students is encapsulated in the school mission 'Developing Students' Potential, Inculcating Moral Integrity & Social Responsibility, Nurturing Resilience & Creativity\" as well as the school core values of CREATE, namely, Compassion, Responsibility, Enterprise, Appreciation, Teamwork and Excellence. Our teachers build quality teacher-student relationships and provide a conducive environment for learning and engagement in and out of the classroom.    As a school, we are committed to develop \"A Flourishing School with Happy and Confident Learners\" through Positive Education (Pos Ed) and Holistic Assessment (HA). Pos Ed focuses on specific skills that empower students to strengthen their relationships, build positive emotions, and celebrate accomplishments in engaging activities that are meaningful and purposeful. The school's culture of care is strengthened through the conscious integration of the 5 tenets of wellbeing which is termed as PERMA (Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationship, Meaning, and Accomplishment). When the the strength of every individual is harnessed consciously, resilience is nurtured in the community and the habit of mindfulness is practised by everyone, the outcome is students FEEL GOOD about themselves and they are motivated and inspired to DO GOOD towards others.   Complementing the above, HA (which is a balanced use of formative and summative assessments) helps students to develop the skills of achievement. Students take ownership of their learning and are engaged in lessons where peers are part of the learning resource. Formative assessments in day to day lessons lead to improvements in achievements as students learn to be self-directed and independent learners.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Da Qiao Primary School's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) \"FLOURISH @ DQ\" is aimed at  developing Character Strengths, Resilience & Mindfulness through Values In Action(VIA) in students. FLOURISH @ DQ focuses on enhancing wellbeing through the provision of learning experiences where values can be put into action.   Students go through a 6-year progressive experience that would bring out their character strengths and develop resilience and mindfulness regardless of their ability level. With the fundamental belief that everyone can flourish, the programme is customised to suit the needs of the students and to develop each student to his fullest potential.   Using the Positive Educational Practices Framework by Martin Seligman, strength, mindfulness and resilience are incorporated in the programme with the 5 basic tenets of wellbeing in mind mainly: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationship, Meaning and Accomplishment. Through the TEACH, EMBED and LIVE approach, the programme equip students with the skills to utilise their strengths in community service. It integrates VIA in all areas and leverages a school-wide structure for students to practise compassion towards self, others and the school community until it develops as a way of life in the school where everyone feels Good and is able to do Good to others. Through the learning of values and practising them in daily life, the programme helps to develop 21st century skills and Social and Emotional Competencies in students.   FLOURISH @ DQ through VIA develops citizenship, the value of responsibility, and many other positive character strengths, making it a highly effective approach to inculcate the skills of wellbeing. In addition to a whole-school approach to VIA and in line with the school's desire to be inclusive, at-risk students and student leaders have customized VIA plans to further build their character strengths of confidence, optimism and humility."
