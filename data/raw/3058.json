Through project work, students monitor their health in novel ways, gather data to analyse, propose and present plans to improve their well-being. Students conduct research and design ways to aid the elderly so that they are empowered to live more fulfilling lives. 'Game for Life', the school's Learning for Life Programme, leverages sports and physical activities to empower students with passion, knowledge and skills to lead a healthy life. Students with sporting talent are progressively developed through exposure to competitive sports within and beyond the school. The school has a proud sporting tradition, especially in Hockey and Floorball, with several of its alumni players representing Singapore in international competitions and many others representing sports clubs in local leagues. The King's Pipe Band which consists of Scottish bagpipes and drums performers, is a part of the Boys' Brigade contingent, and has been highly regarded in South East Asia. For an all-round educational experience, the school also offers level camps, Science Research Programme and Internationalisation Programme to Asian countries where students can gain cross-cultural insights."
