		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "As our foundational programme, we adopted Arthur L. Costa's the Habits of Mind (HOM) to inculcate in BBSSians good learning habits and thinking dispositions so that they can become self-directed, life-long learners.  BBSSians systematically learn the 16 habits through hands-on experiences and then practise these habits daily.  Our LLP is the Community Youth Leadership Programme which aims to nurture RESPECTful Leaders who are confident and self-directed in serving the community with abundance mentality. This programme encompasses the twin pillars of Leadership Development and Values-In-Action (VIA) and provides BBSSians with leadership training experiences like Outward Bound courses and overseas expeditions and opportunities to organise school-wide events like Project Mi and Project Heartwork.  Our ALP is in the area of embedded electronics.  It builds upon the fundamentals of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and aims to develop BBSSians as proactive problem-solvers who care for the world.  This programme focuses on application of sensing technologies in our everyday life."
