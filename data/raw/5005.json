		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "CHIJ Kellock is an all-girl's school with a strong mission-driven tradition. The school has kept on course by providing young girls of all races, religions and backgrounds with a unique brand of education distinctive of the Convent. The school's mission characterized by values of humility and service reflected in the motto of all CHIJ schools around the world - \"Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty\", is an identity worn with pride by every Convent girl. Capitalizing on the unique opportunities afforded in an all-girls' school, the convent education provided in CHIJ Kellock is a commitment to recognizing the dignity of young ladies. The school recognizes that every girl is an individual who can and should strive to do her personal best for herself and for others and is therefore, committed to staying relevant and responsive to the changing educational landscape and demands of the 21st century.  The three tenets of the school vision; LEARN, LEAD and MAKE A DIFFERENCE are realised in the school's strategic directions to develop every Kellock girl's unique giftedness to become a Thoughtful Learner (LEARN), a Servant Leader (LEAD) and a Person for Others (MAKE A DIFFERENCE).  LEARN CHIJ Kellock, the Learning Community, recognises the dynamic nature of its position in a VUCA environment requiring that teaching and learning practices continue to be relevant, responsive, inclusive, committed to discovery, is outcome-oriented and sustainable.   LEAD & MAKE A DIFFERENCE Leadership in CHIJ Kellock is premised on the concept of Servant Leadership, aligned to the school's mission and vision of being persons for others and based on the founder's values that \"the gifts given to you are for others\".",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Character-building is integral to schooling at CHIJ Kellock. As a Christ-centred Learning Community, the students in the school receive a values-based learning experience that pushes them not just to learn but to LEAD and MAKE A DIFFERENCE, anchored on a set of values that form the compass for their words, actions and deeds.  The explicit teaching of values during lessons is done through specially customised Values-Education Lessons that supplement the usual Character and Citizenship Education programme. These lessons teach the students explicitly about what it means to think, speak and act in accordance to the school values, Complementing this effort is the school's Values Alive Series - a series of morning assembly talks conducted by student leaders  to share real life examples of people who have lived out the school values in extraordinary ways.  To help the students translate the values learnt into positive habits and attitudes, the school's PE and Sports CCA curriculum guides the children into thinking about and using relevant habits (inspired by Steven Covey's 8 habits) in their lesson. This Learning for Life programme (LLP) called Net Infinity puts values into action. Similarly, the school's annual Values@Play event provides another platform for students to make connections to the values of Friendship, Excellence, Respect, Resilience and Integrity through specially-designed games.   Central to and of significance to the Kellock Experience is the school's desired outcomes for the girls of the school to be persons of others that will make a difference, no matter their age. This is realised through the Kellock Volunteerism Programme and the annual Children for Children programme which sees the students of our school stepping forward to volunteer their time, energy and effort to make a difference to the disadvantaged in society."
