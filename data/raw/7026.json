		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school has developed a differentiated academic curriculum to meet the needs of the students. In the PL21 programme, 21st Century Competencies are taught and developed within the formal curriculum. Students learn to think creatively and critically and develop  the skill sets to collaborate and communicate effectively. For students with talent in specific subjects and the potential for further growth in an interest area, the school has 2 key programmes dedicated to nurture them. The ACcelerated and Enhanced programme (ACE) is designed to nurture those talented in the areas of Mathematics, Science and Music. A more challenging academic and aesthetics curriculum is customised to their learning needs. The Enhanced Enrichment programme offers opportunities for students to excel in Languages, Humanities, Innovation and Leadership. The Global Classroom programme gives  students the opportunity to travel overseas in any of these 4 aspects; Twinning Programme with overseas institutions, Inter-disciplinary Subject-based Overseas trips, opportunities to represent the school and Singapore at Overseas Conferences and Competitions and the Overseas Service Learning (Values-In-Action) Projects. These trips provide students with the opportunities to interact with people from various parts of the world so that they will be more culturally savvy and attuned to the changing global environment. To complement the academic programme, PLMGS (Sec) has a strong Character and Leadership Development programme. The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
