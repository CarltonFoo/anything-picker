		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The Instructional Programme provides an inclusive, collaborative and experiential curriculum for all students. The customised music curriculum exposes students to various art forms like film music, dance and choreography. Underlying these programmes is the use of Assessment for Learning to build dispositions for lifelong learning. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP)-'Learn, Do, Grow', which integrates Project Work and ICT learning, is offered to all Lower Secondary students. The ALP exposes students to the world of Engineering through the use of Underwater Robotics as an exciting real-world application to their learning. Through our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), we will empower every Regenite to be responsible and confident leader who is committed to excellence. Our fundamental belief is that every individual can be developed as a leader and every student is given the opportunity to hold  a leadership position in his/her four/five years with us. Our Advanced Elective Modules(3 Express) include Introduction of Food Innovation and Everyday Chemistry. Our Elective Modules (3NA,3NT) include  Colour Pencil Rendering, Baking Principles, Papercut & Quiling and Small Business Operations. The Aspiration Programme focuses on a developmental plan from Secondary 1 to 5 using the Discover, Decide, Develop and Dream framework. Guided by 'To Begin With The End In Mind', students are motivated to work hard to realise their potential. Through the Talent Development Programme, the school is committed to help all Regenites realise their potential. Programmes like the Maths & Science Olympiad, Writers-in-Residence and the Youth Arts Incubation allow students to excel in their innate abilities. The Cohort Camps have provided positive experiences to many students through a thematic approach and enabled them to live the school values and hone their leadership skills."
