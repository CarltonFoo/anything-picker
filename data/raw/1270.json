		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Oasis Primary School (OPS) believes that every child can learn and achieve when their needs, interests and abilities are looked into.  We are committed to provide quality education for all children so that they can develop holistically in their moral, emotional, social, cognitive, aesthetic and physical domains and become \"Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders\", children who are capable of learning and innovating continuously. More importantly, they are able to take good care of themselves, their families and the less-privileged, and in turn, contribute back to the society that has nurtured them.  The name of the school conjures up an image of a sanctuary where one can find safety and sustenance that provides an experience that is challenging and enriching. It evolves around building an oasis within a trying environment (desert) where innovations, strengths and positive attributes are necessary to overcome adversities.    Beyond equipping the students with an excellent foundation in literacy and numeracy, the school's programmes will also help them to acquire skills, instincts and competencies to traverse the \"desert\" of tomorrow. The focus will be on processes and skills for the 21st century, in particular communication and teamwork, collaboration, creative problem-solving, cultural intelligence and critical thinking. In OPS, we will engage the parents and together with our teachers, concerted efforts will be made to inculcate the R3ICH (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony) values among the students.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "1) The Leader in Me Programme The school adopts a two-pronged approach in the teaching of 7 Habits namely through explicit teaching and integration of the 7 Habits into the curriculum. For explicit teaching, teachers who are trained will engage the students through thoughtfully designed activities. To ensure pervasiveness in the school, the habits are reinforced through curriculum integration with different focus at different levels.  With pervasive implementation of \"The Leader in Me\", every child will be able to manage and lead self, as well as others confidently. This arises from strong self and social awareness, the ability to manage relationship and make responsible decisions - all of which are important attributes of a Confident Person.  2) Speech and Drama (English & Mother Tongue Languages) The programme aims to engage the students in the oral domain of the languages. Students learn to work and solve problems together as a team. The training sessions help them create remarkable theatre from scratch and build up their level of confidence to speak in front of an audience. Teachers and students would also have opportunities to work together to create settings and scenarios from their own imaginative ideas and this would improve teacher-student interaction.  3) Programme for Active Learning (PAL) PAL gives our students the chance to learn beyond the four walls of a classroom to discover new interests, learn new skills and build their characters, besides providing opportunities for them to develop confidence and forge friendship. PAL modules are experiential in nature and incorporate learning in a creative, fun and enjoyable way. Through their participation in this programme, our students become more confident with themselves, exhibit more leadership qualities and learn to take care and respect others."
