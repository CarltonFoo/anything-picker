		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Our School's Vision \"Empowered Learners, Creative Minds\" espouses the desire to nurture our students to be Confident, Creative, Conscientious and Caring Citizens (5Cs). In working towards achieving these 5Cs, we firmly believe that students need to be equipped with knowledge, life skills and 21st Century Competencies (21CC) for success in school and in life. The ideals require us not only to imbue head knowledge but also strong moral values and strength of judgement to be caring citizens. The school has embarked on a programme of Personal and Social Effectiveness (PSE) for students based on Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People since 2006.   The school takes a student-centric approach and creates opportunities for students to develop curiosity for knowledge and the inclination to think critically and creatively. Since 2012, the school has incorporated 21CC in the total curriculum.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In engaging the learners, we focus on quality learning experiences and outcomes. This is done through curriculum innovations, leveraging on technology, inculcation of thinking skills and the inclusion of differentiated programmes to cater to student needs. Examples of curriculum innovations include Drama Programme, Talent Development Programme (TDP), Problem-Based Learning (PBL) programme and our Applied Learning Programme: 'Creative Problem Solving through Robotics'. These programmes aim to engender self-directed and collaborative learning and nurture critical and creative problem solving skills.   Besides the academic domain, the school focuses on Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) as well as aesthetics appreciation and physical education to develop our students holistically. This emphasis has played an important role in developing our students to become responsible and caring citizens. The school leverages VIA programmes to enhance the learning of school values and also develop in students a stronger sense of rootedness to Singapore. With the School's Lifelong Learning Programme - A Confident & Caring Leader - Leading Through C.A.R.E, we seize the opportunities to develop our students to be leaders for tomorrow."
