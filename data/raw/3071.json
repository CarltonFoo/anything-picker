		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Academic and Affective programmes nurture Vistarians to be confident and competent individuals; ready to love, learn and serve with passion in a globalised world.  The Academic Programme ensures that all students receive an all-round education which is Exciting, Enriching and Engaging. To meet this objective, the learning environment in the school is challenging, diverse, interactive and supportive with dedicated staff that work for the betterment of each student. Through its Affective Programmes such as the Leadership Programme, the NV Goes Global Programme and Character Education Programmes, students are offered a broad range of experiences and encourage their interest in and outside of the academic domain both within and beyond our shores.  The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) entitled Investigative Science in Health and Sports, develops students' interest in learning through investigative science. It provides students with platforms to learn and apply their knowledge in the area of forensics. Students are taught the skills of research and use the techniques of molecular gastronomy to prepare nutrition bars for athletes.  The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Nurturing Creative Problem Solvers through the Arts and Design - aims to develop active citizens who are able to empathize with, and respond creatively to, the needs of the community. Students gain authentic and experiential learning experiences through Vista Week which provides them with a week of culture, adventure and reflection. Terrific Thursdays and Fabulous Fridays also offer students a myriad of learning opportunities beyond the classroom. The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
