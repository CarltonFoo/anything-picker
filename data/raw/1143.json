		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "In Yio Chu Kang Primary, we believe that every child has the potential to learn and achieve. Guided by our school philosophy, we seek to bring out the best in every child.  We are committed to ignite the joy of learning in every child and provide opportunities for discovery and exploration. We bring up the happy child who is confident, curious and caring. The child will learn to interact well with his peers, think critically and take responsibility for his learning. Learning and teaching in YCKPS is guided by the school's Curriculum Framework. Central to the Curriculum Framework is the school's vision, Empowering Mind, Engaging Heart, Extending Hands. The ultimate goal of our Curriculum is to develop every YCKPS student into the Self-directed Learner, Confident Person, Concerned Citizen, and Active Contributor. The school harnesses five key learning approaches, Differentiation, Authenticity and Relevance, Experiential, Collaboration and Integration, to provide enriching and engaging experiences for the holistic development of our students.   Through our academic programmes, we build in every child a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy. Our school-based curriculum creates experiences that enable our learners to see connections across disciplines and acquire competencies such as critical thinking, collaboration and communication skills that will enable them to thrive in the fast-changing future landscape.   We imbue in our learners core values so that they grow up to be morally upright individuals who are globally aware while being rooted as Singaporeans. The school's values of Caring, Upright, Progressive and Excellence are constantly reinforced to guide both staff and students in their thoughts, actions and behaviour. We provide opportunities for our students to reflect on the needs of the community and how they could serve others by putting their values in action. Through this, we nurture the 'Youth of Character, Keen to Serve'.",
