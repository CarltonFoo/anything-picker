		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In broadening and deepening students' learning, Broadrick Secondary School has made significant progress in its journey to develop two distinctive programmes.  In 2014, we are recognised by MOE for our Applied Learning Programme (Entrepreneurship and Innovation) and Learning for Life Programme (Service Learning). Our Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is closely aligned to the school's vision of nurturing achievers with strength of character. It also aims to help our students to become inquisitive leaders, and critical and creative thinkers who embrace the spirit of creativity and enterprise. The programme also supports the school's effort to inculcate one of our school values - Enterprise. Through workshops and specific curriculum lessons, our students learn about innovation, design thinking, marketing and examine commercial viability in product designs. Service Learning is our adopted methodology for experiential learning to develop character and 21st century competencies in our students. Our comprehensive Service Learning programme is structured to be part of the school curriculum and every student is given an opportunity to be exposed to rich, authentic learning experiences as they work with others and with the community at large. Through these platforms, we aim to progressively develop important life skills in students, such as critical thinking, communication, leadership and active citizenry."
