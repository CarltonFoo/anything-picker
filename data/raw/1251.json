		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Toy Story is one of the school's distinctive programmes.  It aims to develop pupils' critical and inventive thinking skills through toy design.  Our pupils are taught thinking skills such as Edward de Bono's 6 Thinking Hats and are encouraged to ask questions as they gather information to help them in their tasks.  The process of questioning and clarification leads to the discovery of science concepts and reinforces their learning from the Science syllabus.  They will also reflect and work on improvements to their toys based on peer and teacher reviews.  Our pupils have the opportunity to contribute in consensus building and group decisions and build their confidence in small group settings.    With the aim of developing future-ready individuals, the school has also introduced a distinctive programme that focuses on outdoor education.  The programme caters for both mass level participation from Primary 1 to Primary 6 and development of selected pupils who demonstrate stronger interest and ability in outdoor activities.  By taking learning beyond the classrooms, our pupils acquire relevant life skills and learn to appreciate and care for the environment.  They also become more adaptable and confident through their active participation in various age-appropriate outdoor activities such as sports climbing, hiking and adventure camps.    Co-curricular Activities (CCAs), learning journeys and values-in-action activities play significant roles in the holistic development of our pupils.  At Primary 1 and 2, every pupil participates in programmes such as drama, visual arts and dance.  For Primary 3 to 6 pupils, we offer over 20 CCAs such as chess, uniformed groups, guitar and international dance.  Our pupils develop their character and leadership through active CCA involvement."
