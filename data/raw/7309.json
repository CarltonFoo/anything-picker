		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Fairfield is a Methodist school built on the foundation of God's love. Founded in 1888 by a missionary, Miss Sophia Blackmore, the school provides a holistic education based on Christian values. We believe that God places students in our school for a special reason. Hence we are committed to helping all students develop their talents to the full, and nurture the four Fairsian Outcomes of wisdom, personhood, commitment to community and heart of service. The Fairfield curriculum is undergirded by the WHEEL philosophy to provide Fairsians with holistic, enriched and experiential learning. We strongly believe that education should go beyond the boundaries of the syllabuses and that students should be given a chance to explore beyond the classroom. We also believe that students should be engaged in meaningful and authentic experiences so that deep learning can occur when they reflect, connect the dots and seek to apply what they have learned in a real world context. The Fairfield curriculum also seeks to develop strong moral and performance character as we nurture leaders with a strong personal voice who can exert a gracious and positive influence on the community.",
