		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "In Farrer Park Primary School (FPPS), we believe that every child must grow up to be gentle and humble in spirit, generous in compassion, always gracious and respectful towards others.  He must agrow up, a dignified individual and a caring leader who contributes actively to the community in his own capacity. We believe that every child must develop the spirit of adventure to explore and pursue his interests, his talents, and his imagination, his sense of curiosity and wonder.  He must also develop his cognitive and linguistic abilities to express his thoughts and opinions confidently and critically.  Importantly, he must grow up with the disposition and ability to learn, unlearn and relearn so that he will be well placed in secondary school, and for the future. We believe that every child must find joy in learning and be inspired to be the best that he can be, and to achieve the best that he can in his learning. He should set high expectations for himself in his pursuits of his interests and talents and find his sense of purpose and meaningfulness in what he wishes to do or to grow up to become. We believe that every child learns best when the environment is safe and nurturing; and he is free to express himself: his needs, his aspirations, his thoughts and his feelings. The learning environment should also encourage him to interact with one another through which he learns to appreciate diverse perspectives and ideas, the needs of others and itheir interests. We believe in the growth mindset that the child can achieve far more than what we can imagine because every child can learn and find success, given the right conditions. We will affirm every child's efforts to learn and guide him in his pursuits.  We believe that success is defined more than mere grades or scores; it is about developing the whole child. As educators in FPPS, every child that passes through our hands is special; each different, each with hopes and dreams, everyone important.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "FPPS has two distinctive programmes (LLP & ALP). Put together, the programmes develop confident persons and caring leaders in our students.  Our ALP, iDREaM, a 6-year programme, uses drama to empower students to think critically and develop their own voice in response to different experiences.  All FPPS students attend process drama lessons during which they explore complex real world issues. Teachers will then facilitate discussions on these issues with the aim to provide students opportunities to articulate their opinions and thinking, using evidence from the text to support their reasoning and decisions. Through process drama, students develop critical and inventive thinking skills, sound and logical reasoning skills and become confident, self-assured individuals. They also learn to appreciate different perspectives through active listening. In FPPS, ALP cuts both English and Mother-Tongue languages. FPPS collaborates with external partners such as Singapore Polytechnic to provide our students greater opportunities to learn through drama.    Our LLP, iCARE, a 6-year developmental programme, develops students to be Caring, Adaptable, Responsible and Enterprising Leaders of Tomorrow.  Through iCARE our students grow up to be concerned citizens and active contributors, and learn to give time and effort to reach out to others in need. Hence, students are given meaningful and authentic experiences to develop and demonstrate their leadership skills. Students with greater leadership potential are given opportunities to hone their leadership skills by initiating, planning and executing various projects, targeting at serving the school and community such as initiating and planning visits to old folks' homes, and to other communities in need.  In iCARE, teachers faciitate students' learning through individual and individual reflections to deepen their learning about self, others and their role in the community."
