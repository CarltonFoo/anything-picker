		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's LLP, Developing Social Emotional Learning Competencies through Outdoor Adventure Learning, provides all students with authentic experiences to hone their Social Emotional Competencies and  demonstrate the school core values of Responsibility, Integrity, Care, Perseverance and Forward-Looking. Through exploring their environment, both local and overseas, they not only challenge themselves but also collaborate with one another to achieve their goals. The programme will bring students out of their comfort zones, allowing them to discover their potential to overcome challenges and build their character. The school's ALP, Developing 21st Century Competencies through an Inquiry Approach in Health Science and Technology, provides students with the opportunity to apply academic knowledge learnt across disciplines to authentic situations. Students acquire critical and inventive thinking dispositions and communications skills which prepares them for the complexities and challenges faced in the era of innovation and uncertainty. To develop confident and self-directed learners who take responsibility for their own learning, the school engages its students through a blended learning approach, which allows the thoughtful integration of ICT and a rich array of structured learning opportunities.  Key anchor programmes such as the Chingay Project for English and Humanities, Science Lower Seletar Reservoir Project, and Learning Mother Tongue through Drama and experiential learning journeys help to ignite interest and joy in learning."
