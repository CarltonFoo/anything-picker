The tagline for this programme is Fun Ideas Serious Solutions. Through the school-based innovation curriculum, all P1-P6 students are progressively taught critical thinking, creative thinking, problem-solving and decision-making skills through Project Work. To enable the students to authentically apply their learning, the school integrates Project Work with Values-in-Action (VIA) programme. For our students who are inclined towards innovation, the school has established an Innovation Club to provide intensive training and exposure to competitions to hone their innovation skills. Students create products and embark on projects that help solve community issues.  In providing holistic education, the school conducts modular programmes for Music and Art. The students are also exposed to Environment Education through structured programmes that are organised throughout the year. With the setting up of Solar eHaven, an open garden-like learning deck on sustainable energy, Environment Education is integrated into the Science curriculum. There are various stations where pupils have hands-on activities to learn about energy conversion."
