		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Unique to the school is the lower secondary Learning for Life Programme (LLP), a curriculum designed to expose every student to drama, visual arts, dance and music. Opportunities are provided for students to hone their talents through performances such as Lunchtime Performances, school concerts and the biennial Night of Music, Arts and Dance (NOMAD). In 'Developing 21st Century Learners', the school has embarked on Alternative Modes of Assessment  (AMA) as a whole-school approach to engage students in Assessment for Learning and Assessment as Learning, so as to cultivate self-directed and independent learners. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), 'Environment Science & Sustainable Living', equips students with 21st century competencies by developing them in scientific inquiry skills. The school is implementing greater flexibility in subject offering at lower secondary levels. Eligible N(A) and N(T) students can take some subjects at a higher level starting from Secondary 1, based on their PSLE results. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects."
