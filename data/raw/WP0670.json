Learning is integrated through play, discovery and creative activities. Music literacy, language and the arts are integral components of the Kinderland Integrated Curriculum (KIC), and we provide electronic music keyboards for our children to learn keyboarding skills under the tutelage of qualified music teachers.\n\nKinderland?s proprietary curricula are uniquely designed by an in-house curriculum research and development team, which is supported by an international advisory panel from Australia, America, China and Singapore.\n\nKinderland currently has more than 40 preschools and child care centres in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh.",
